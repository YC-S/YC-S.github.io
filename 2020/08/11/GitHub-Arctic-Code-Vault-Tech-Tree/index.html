  <p><strong>Introduction: A Guide To The Tech Tree</strong></p>
<p>What follows, which we call the Tech Tree, is a selection of works intended to describe how the world makes and uses software today, as well as an overview of how computers work and the foundational technologies required to make and use computers. The purpose of the GitHub Archive Program is to preserve open source software for future generations. This implies also preserving the knowledge of other technologies on which open-source software runs, along with a depiction of the open-source movement which brought this software into being.</p>
<p>In addition to this technical documentation, we have also included a selection of artistic, cultural, and historical works, to help describe the overall cultural context in which this archive was created, and a series of dictionaries, to aid translation into several of the world’s most widespread other languages.</p>
<p>This initial version of the Tech Tree will consist almost entirely of copies of pre-existing works, none of which were written for an unknown audience a long way into the future. As such it is not so much a guide as a collection of resources that we hope will be historically interesting and/or useful. We have tried to strike a balance between abstract/theoretical and concrete/practical work, and to provide at least an overview of the entire technical stack on which modern software engineering rests.</p>
<p>Please note that this document is currently a loose “wish list” of works that we may like to include, which we are making public for the purpose of actively soliciting further suggestions and input, rather than a finalized register of selected works. Note also that the prospect of copying works onto microfilm in a human-readable form implies both potential copyright issues and the practical consideration of acquiring a copyable digital version of the work in question. Certain publishers (Packt, O’Reilly, Springer, and Wiley) have indicated they are happy to work with us, while the status for most other publishers and copyright holders remains indeterminate.</p>
<p>The proposed Tech Tree is loosely divided into the following sixteen sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Fundamentals of computing and the Internet:</em> the essentials of how computers work, and, at least as important to today’s world, how they are connected together into a single planetary network which includes most of the computers on Earth.</li>
<li><em>Algorithms and data structures</em>: processes, sets of rules, and methods of arranging data to solve common categories of problems in efficient ways. Metaphorically, algorithms are the intelligence in a software program, and data structures are its storage.</li>
<li><em>Compilers, assembler, and operating systems:</em> how written source code becomes the machine code which causes the electrical signals inside a computer to change in a controlled manner, and the theory of operating systems, the software which supports a computer’s basic functions and provides the fundamental, low-level functionality that all other software ultimately calls upon.</li>
<li><em>Programming languages:</em> some of the world’s most popular and widely used programming languages described in detail. While, fundamentally, any program can be written in any language, certain languages are better or worse at particular tasks.</li>
<li><em>Networking and connectivity</em>: how computers connect to one another, via physical wires and radio signals, both one-on-one and in larger networks. Includes descriptions of the structure of the global “network of networks” known as the Internet, which connects most of the computers on Earth.</li>
<li><em>Modern software development:</em> the processes and procedures of dealing with software projects, tools, and services at scale, with constant monitoring and communication, at assured levels of quality.</li>
<li><em>Modern software applications:</em> in-depth description of applications such as Web development (the Web is, essentially, that part of the Internet used to display output and receive input from human beings); scientific research and analysis; image processing; pattern recognition and generation via neural networks; software distributed across many different computers; cryptocurrencies, which can be used as a platform for trustless decentralized software; and the new field of quantum computing.</li>
<li><em>Hardware architectures:</em> the concepts, structures, and layout of computer hardware. Hardware refers to physical electronic components; hardware architecture refers to how those components are structured and connected in order to run software; and software ultimately becomes ephemeral patterns of electricity within those physical components.</li>
<li><em>Hardware development:</em> how to build simple computers from collections of electronic components, along with technical descriptions of drones, robots, and digital cameras.</li>
<li><em>Electronic components, transistors, semiconductor manufacturing</em>: those electronic components which predated computers, along with individual transistors, the component from which computers are made, and an overview of the technologies and processes of fabricating interconnected transistors at scale.</li>
<li><em>Electricity, radios, and other industrial technologies:</em> fundamental pre-computer technologies, regarding generating usable electrical power, transmitting it over wires, using it to convey information without wires over great distances via radio, and basic industrial metalworking.</li>
<li><em>Pre-industrial technologies:</em> technologies of eras which predated electricity.</li>
<li><em>Women and technology:</em> an overview of the oft-erased role of women in the development of software and other technologies.</li>
<li><em>Languages</em>: a dictionary of English along with translational dictionaries intended to help readers convert from English to Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, and Spanish, the world’s other four most-used languages.</li>
<li><em>Arts, culture, and history</em>: human histories and changing human cultures, mostly through the lens of celebrated fictional narratives written over the last 150 years.</li>
<li><em>Cultural context</em>: information about humanity at the time the Tech Tree was created; in particular, a snapshot of Wikipedia, a collectively generated repository of all sorts of information about our world. Due to Wikipedia’s enormous size, this section is provided as encoded data, like the rest of the archive, rather than as visual/readable pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first seven sections are devoted to software, the purpose and content of the GitHub Arctic Code Vault, and its uses and applications. The next five sections describe the technologies required to construct computers on which software might run. The remaining three are intended to illustrate the human context in which these technologies have been developed, the stories the cultures of our era told, the languages in which we told them, and the factual background and descriptions of the world in which we lived.</p>
<p>The Tech Tree is part of the much larger GitHub Arctic Code Vault. As such, it also includes, as an appendix, visual copies of the Guide to the GitHub Code Vault, along with an index of the archive’s fifteen thousand most significant code repositories, including brief descriptions and locations within the archive.</p>
<p>It is perhaps worth noting that our advisory board stressed that ours is likely to be the best-documented era in human history by far, so bundling the Tech Tree with the archive is likely to be more convenient than essential for its inheritors. As such, it is entirely possible – indeed quite likely – that its value will consist largely of providing context regarding the era and culture in which the archive was created, rather than as a source of new and unavailable knowledge, though of course there are imaginable futures in which it plays the latter role.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief summary of each section, describing both the general topics it covers, and the works the Tech Tree includes to document our current understanding of those topics.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamentals of computing and the Internet</strong></p>
<p>These books describe what computers are, from the silicon up – electricity, transistors, binary logic, digital gates, bits, bytes, chips, ALUs, microprocessors, software – as well as introducing what they can do. It also includes books which describe, at a high level, how computers can be connected together, and what that means. The works in question are:</p>

<p><em>Introduction to Networking: How the Internet Works</em> by Charles Severance, illustrated by Mauro Toselli and Aimee Andrion (Charles Severance)</p>
<p><strong>Algorithms and data structures</strong></p>
<p>These are the fundamentals of computer science, and hence the foundation of software engineering; describing how data is structured and stored, and the most effective and efficient ways in which it can be processed.</p>

<p><em>PostgreSQL Development Essentials</em> by Manpreet Kaur, Baji Shaik (Packt)</p>
<p><strong>Compilers, assembler, and operating systems</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Archive Program is to preserve software, and these are the fundamental building blocks of software. These books help to explain how high-level written software becomes low-level electrical impulses:</p>
<p><em>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, Tools</em> by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman (Addison Wesley)</p>
<p><em>Practical Compiler Construction</em> by Des Watson (Springer)</p>

<p><strong>Programming languages</strong></p>
<p>There are hundreds of programming languages; the enormous chart visualizing their evolution at the Computer History Museum is worth visiting if you’re a developer, and we don’t intend to document them all. Still, accessible book-length descriptions of a selection of the world’s major languages seems desirable.</p>

<p><strong>Networking and connectivity</strong></p>
<p>Computers are great, but in a way, so 20th century; it’s <em>networked</em> computers which are, at least arguably, the real technical revolution of the 21st. As such our networking protocols and technologies deserve considerable attention. We might hope our inheritors will either have long surpassed our networking, or will have the freedom to design anew rather than be shackled by all the compromises we’ve needed to make for the sake of backwards compatibility but either way, hopefully they can learn something from what we’ve done. Which is described by:</p>

<p><em>Computer and Information Security Handbook</em> by John R. Vacca (Elsevier)</p>
<p><strong>Modern software development</strong></p>
<p>The line-by-line act of writing software is quite different from the team-by-team process of developing, testing, integrating, and deploying it. A few key approaches, tools, and roles are described here, including, for obvious reasons, unpacking Git itself.</p>

<p><em>Designing Distributed Systems</em> by Brendan Burns (O’Reilly)</p>
<p><strong>Modern software applications</strong></p>
<p>It would take a tech forest, not a tree, to even try to describe all of the uses to which software is put. However, some depictions of how individual projects and libraries are knit together into powerful networked applications seem valuable, as do overviews of e.g. virtualization, “big data” software, and especially machine learning.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware architectures</strong></p>
<p>The spectrum of complexity from a single analog transistor to a modern multicore processor is, needless to say, difficult to summarize.

<p><strong>Electronic components, transistors, semiconductor manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>A more low-level analysis of fundamental electronic components and transistor-based circuitry, along with textbooks describing lithography and chip manufacturing. Obviously such manufacturing is essentially impossible to recreate from scratch (Moore’s lesser-known second law described how fabricator costs increase just as chip density decreases) but these works could conceivably be of historical or even practical significance.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-industrial technologies</strong></p>
<p>These are the works which address the “romantic catastrophe” image of the archive’s inheritors, who seek to reboot all of modern technological civilization from pre-industrial scratch. Such possible futures do exist, although they seem unlikely; furthermore, it seems possible that these works might help fill in gaps which arise in historical knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Women and Technology</strong></p>
<p>We believe women’s unique role in founding and shaping computing and technology deserves its own section. Women’s erasure in the field has meant there aren’t always primary sources from the original time of contribution (like books authored by women), and historians are finding that women’s contributions have been quite significant. Including this section allows us to appropriately acknowledge the work. Special thanks to Mar Hicks; many references in this section borrow from their Women in Computing course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We also include literature discussing tech’s negative impact on women.</p>

<p><em>Gender Codes: Why Women are Leaving Computing</em> by Thomas J. Misa (Wiley)</p>
<p><strong>Languages</strong></p>
<p>Our professional linguistic advice was that, contrary to popular belief, the drift of English syntax and grammar has slowed dramatically, and barring some massive catastrophe it’s very likely that English will both survive and be largely recognizable a thousand years from now. To hedge our bets, though, we have included a “Rosetta” guide translated into Arabic, Hindi, Spanish, and Chinese in every reel of the Archive, along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in every available written language, and will similarly include dictionaries and a couple of linguistic works here.</p>
<p><em>The Oxford Dictionary of English</em> (OUP)</p>
<p><em>Oxford Picture Dictionary English-Arabic</em> Edition (OUP)</p>
<p><em>Oxford Picture Dictionary English-Chinese</em> Edition (OUP)</p>
<p><em>Oxford Picture Dictionary English-Spanish</em> Edition (OUP)</p>
<p><em>The History Of Languages: An Introduction</em> by Tore Janson (OUP)</p>
<p><em>Linguistic Diversity</em> by Daniel Nettle (OUP)</p>
<p><strong>Fiction, culture, and history</strong></p>
<p>It is our belief that culture is often best expressed through great works of fiction. As such, we sought to assemble a list of notable literary works (including / beginning with a few books of nonfiction) to convey, on a human level, the history and culture of our time. These are:</p>
<p><em>Chapman’s Homer</em></p>
<p><em>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</em></p>
<p><em>The Tale of Genji</em> by Murasaki Shikibu</p>
<p><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
<p><em>I, Claudius</em> by Robert Graves</p>
<p><em>Star Maker</em> by Olaf Stapledon</p>
<p><em>Things Fall Apart</em> by Chinua Achebe (Penguin)</p>
<p><em>Brave New World</em> by Aldous Huxley (Harper Perennial)</p>
<p><em>1984</em> by George Orwell (Signet Classics)</p>
<p><em>A Canticle For Leibowitz</em> by Walter M. Miller Jr. (Spectra)</p>
<p><em>The Cairo Trilogy</em> by Naguib Mahfouz (Everyman’s)</p>
<p><em>Cyberiad</em> by Stanislaw Lem (Mariner)</p>
<p><em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em> by Robert Heinlein (Ace)</p>
<p><em>The Dispossessed</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin (HarperCollins)</p>
<p><em>One Hundred Years Of Solitude</em> by Gabriel García Márquez (Harper Perennial)</p>
<p><em>Parable of the Sower</em> by Octavia Butler (Grand Central)</p>
<p><em>Wild Swans</em> by Jung Chang (Simon &amp; Schuster)</p>
<p><em>The Conservationist</em> by Nadine Gordimer (Penguin)</p>
<p><em>The Book of the New Sun</em> by Gene Wolfe (Tor)</p>
<p><em>Midnight’s Children</em> by Salman Rushdie (Random House)</p>
<p><em>The Famished Road</em> by Ben Okri (Anchor)</p>
<p><em>Beloved</em> by Toni Morrison (Vintage)</p>
<p><em>A Place Of Greater Safety</em> by Hilary Mantel (Holt)</p>
<p><em>Foucault’s Pendulum</em> by Umberto Eco (Mariner)</p>
<p><em>Alias Grace</em> by Margaret Atwood (Anchor)</p>
<p><em>Blood Meridian</em> by Cormac McCarthy (Vintage)</p>
<p><em>The Stone Diaries</em> by Carol Shields (Penguin)</p>
<p><em>The God of Small Things</em> by Arundhati Roy (Random House)</p>
<p><em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em> by Haruki Murakami (Vintage)</p>
<p><em>Anathem</em> by Neal Stephenson (William Morrow)</p>
<p><em>2666</em> by Roberto Bolaño (Picador)</p>
<p><em>The Goldfinch</em> by Donna Tartt (Little, Brown)</p>
<p><em>The Peripheral</em> by William Gibson (Berkley)</p>
<p><em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson (Broadway)</p>
<p><em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em> by Edward Tufte (Graphics Press)</p>
<p><em>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness Of Crowds</em> by Charles Mackay</p>
<p><strong>Cultural context</strong></p>
<p>This section of the Tech Tree is intended to convey both useful practical information from our culture, and a depiction of what it was like at the time the archive was written. It will consist of encoded data, rather than imaged pages, largely because its centerpiece, a snapshot of Wikipedia, is far too large for the latter format.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, while not without its flaws and omissions, is the most readily available proxy for “a written summary of our world.” Note that this section is by no means intended as a complete depiction of humanity today: as our advisors stressed, this era is likely to be the best documented in all of human history, and such information is very unlikely to be difficult to find. Rather, it is intended as a convenience to indicate to the archive’s inheritors the specific, particular context of the era in which the archive was written.</p>
<p>This section will also include several other data sources recommended by GitHub’s community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiktionary</li>
<li>Wikispecies</li>
<li>The File Formats Archive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The GitHub Arctic Code Vault</strong></p>
<p>As the Tech Tree is a companion piece to the GitHub Arctic Code Vault, it will contain an index with the name, brief description, and film reel number for all of the GitHub repositories stored in the Arctic Code Vault, i.e. every active public GitHub repo as of 02/02/2020.</p>
<p>This index will also highlight the 15,000 GitHub repositories which are the most-starred or most-depended-on at the time the archive was written. (These are also the repositories which will be stored in the two-reel “greatest hits” subsets of the archive, to be kept with partners such as Oxford’s Bodleian Library and others.)</p>
<p>It is worth noting that every individual reel of the Arctic Code Vault also has its own index itemizing its contents, along with all of the instructions and information required to decode the information stored in that reel. This master index will be a superset of all of those indexes, to serve as a backup and a convenience for the archive’s inheritors.</p>
