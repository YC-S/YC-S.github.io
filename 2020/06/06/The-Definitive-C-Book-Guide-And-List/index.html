Still a good, short but complete introduction to C (C90, not C99 or later versions), written by the inventor of C. However, the language has changed and good C style has developed in the last 25 years, and there are parts of the book that show its age.</li>

Covers C in 5 levels (encounter, acquaintance, cognition, experience, ambition) from beginning C to advanced C. It covers C11 and C17, including threads and atomic access, which few other books do. Not all compilers recognize these features in all environments.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/cii/">C Interfaces and Implementations</a> - David R. Hanson (1997). Provides information on how to define a boundary between an interface and implementation in C in a generic and reusable fashion. It also demonstrates this principle by applying it to the implementation of common mechanisms and data structures in C, such as lists, sets, exceptions, string manipulation, memory allocators, and more. Basically, Hanson took all the code he’d written as part of building <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon">Icon</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">lcc</a> and pulled out the best bits in a form that other people could reuse for their own projects. It’s a model of good C programming using modern design techniques (including Liskov’s data abstraction), showing how to organize a big C project as a bunch of useful libraries.</p>

<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201179288">C Traps and Pitfalls</a> by A. Koenig (1989). Very good, but the C style pre-dates standard C, which makes it less recommendable these days.</p>
<p>Some have argued for the removal of ‘Traps and Pitfalls’ from this list because it has trapped some people into making mistakes; others continue to argue for its inclusion. Perhaps it should be regarded as an ‘expert’ book because it requires a moderately extensive knowledge of C to understand what’s changed since it was published.</p>

<p>Although this isn’t a book as such, many programmers recommend reading and implementing as much of it as possible. MISRA-C was originally intended as guidelines for safety-critical applications in particular, but it applies to any area of application where stable, bug-free C code is desired (who doesn’t want fewer bugs?). MISRA-C is becoming the de facto standard in the whole embedded industry and is getting increasingly popular even in other programming branches. There are (at least) three publications of the standard (1998, 2004, and the current version from 2012). There is also a MISRA Compliance Guidelines document from 2016, and MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 — Additional Security Guidelines for MISRA C:2012 (published in April 2016).<br>Note that some of the strictures in the MISRA rules are not appropriate to every context. For example, directive 4.12 states “Dynamic memory allocation shall not be used”. This is appropriate in the embedded systems for which the MISRA rules are designed; it is not appropriate everywhere. (Compilers, for instance, generally use dynamic memory allocation for things like symbol tables, and to do without dynamic memory allocation would be difficult, if not preposterous.)</p>

In particular, you should stay away from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0072121246">C: The Complete Reference</a> (4th Edition, 2000), known in some circles as C: The Complete Nonsense.</p>
<p>Also do not use the book <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/9387284492/">Let Us C</a> (16th Edition, 2017) by Yashwant Kanetkar. Many people view it as an outdated book that teaches Turbo C and has lots of obsolete, misleading and incorrect material. For example, page 137 discusses the expected output from <code>printf(&quot;%d %d %d\n&quot;, a, ++a, a++)</code> and does not categorize it as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/949433/why-are-these-constructs-using-pre-and-post-increment-undefined-behavior">undefined behaviour</a> as it should.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://learncodethehardway.org/c/">Learn C The Hard Way</a> (2015) by Zed Shaw. A book with mixed reviews. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hentenaar.com/dont-learn-c-the-wrong-way">A critique of this book</a> by Tim Hentenaar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To summarize my views, which are laid out below, the author presents the material in a greatly oversimplified and misleading way, the whole corpus is a bundled mess, and some of the opinions and analyses he offers are just plain wrong. I’ve tried to view this book through the eyes of a novice, but unfortunately I am biased by years of experience writing code in C. It’s obvious to me that either the author has a flawed understanding of C, or he’s deliberately oversimplifying to the point where he’s actually misleading the reader (intentionally or otherwise.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Learn C The Hard Way” is not a book that I could recommend to someone who is both learning to program and learning C. If you’re already a competent programmer in some other related language, then it represents an interesting and unusual exposition on C, though I have reservations about parts of the book. <em>Jonathan Leffler</em></p>
