  <h3 id="Find-a-learning-method-that-works-for-you"><a href="#Find-a-learning-method-that-works-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Find a learning method that works for you"></a>Find a learning method that works for you</h3><p>This is the first and most valuable tip I can share with you. It‚Äôs something that took me the longest time to realise, and which has helped me the most on my developer journey. If you only take away 1 thing from this article, let it be this.</p>
<p>When you are new to the world of code, it makes sense to tread in the footsteps of others. At the time of writing, a quick ‚Äúlearning how to code‚Äù Google search brings up more than <em>10.6 billion</em> results! It‚Äôs safe to say that coding is gaining popularity and there are tons of platforms and resources, but with that also come millions of opinions on how to get started. Before you buy a handful of recommended books and courses, first answer this: <strong>What is the most effective way for you to learn new concepts?</strong></p>
<p>Do you prefer to learn through books or documentation? Video tutorials? Interactive tutorials? Or perhaps you prefer to immediately get your hands dirty by building small projects and to solve problems as you go.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre unsure about which way is best for you, feel free to experiment with this and to try out different methods. <strong>Learning a new topic on your own offers the luxury of being able to fully personalise and customise your journey and curriculum ‚Äî use this to your advantage and find something that works for you!</strong></p>
<h3 id="Don‚Äôt-be-afraid-to-drop-popular-resources"><a href="#Don‚Äôt-be-afraid-to-drop-popular-resources" class="headerlink" title="Don‚Äôt be afraid to drop (popular) resources"></a>Don‚Äôt be afraid to drop (popular) resources</h3><p>If you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt like to leave things unfinished, this can be a hard thing to do. I lost count of how many resources (books, online courses, etc.) I tried just because they were heavily recommended. Ultimately, I only ended up sticking with a handful of resources because many others did not suit my skill level (or preferred way of learning), or because the explanation was insufficient for me.</p>
<p>Are you not enjoying or learning much from a course that seems to be loved by everyone else? Don‚Äôt get discouraged or doubt your competence, or get stuck on a resource that you dislike. <strong>Drop it or save it for later if you feel like it‚Äôs only introducing more questions rather than answering them. There are always plenty of alternatives!</strong></p>
<h3 id="Slow-down-and-start-with-the-basics"><a href="#Slow-down-and-start-with-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Slow down and start with the basics"></a>Slow down and start with the basics</h3><p>It‚Äôs no secret that the tech industry moves <em>fast</em>. Blink twice and someone is suddenly mentioning a brand new framework, website generator or CMS; libraries and packages are continuously being released left and right.</p>
<p>This can be daunting and truth be told, it‚Äôs hard to keep up. If you‚Äôre self-studying, make sure you grasp the basics first. Don‚Äôt worry about not knowing React, and focus on understanding JavaScript first. There‚Äôs no need to look at Tailwind or Styled Components just yet‚Äîinstead, prioritise becoming comfortable with writing CSS. Everything else will come in due time (spoiler alert: you don‚Äôt always need to work with the latest and greatest technologies!).</p>
<h3 id="Apply-your-growth-mindset-and-know-your-motivation"><a href="#Apply-your-growth-mindset-and-know-your-motivation" class="headerlink" title="Apply your growth mindset and know your motivation"></a>Apply your growth mindset and know your motivation</h3><p>Apply a growth mindset (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this <em>yet</em>‚Äù) and find the real reason(s) you want to learn how to code. What is it that you enjoy about it the most? What would you like to use your new skills for? Having your motivation clear will not only make learning more fun, but it will also make you more resilient in frustrating times when your code is not working as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Try not to compare yourself to other learners as everyone has their own timeline and techniques.</strong> Keep an eye on your goals, but don‚Äôt forget to look back sometimes and see how far you have already come. This may sound straightforward and obvious, but progress is not always immediately visible. Don‚Äôt be too harsh on yourself and enjoy the ride! Good luck!</p>

  <p>the creator of WordPress, spoke about JavaScript in his yearly keynote ‚ÄúThe State of Word‚Äù. In it, he gave the WordPress community homework ‚Äî to <strong>Learn JavaScript, Deeply</strong>. To go out and make 2016 the year that you finally take those steps into getting comfortable with JavaScript.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/KrZx4IY1IgU">https://youtu.be/KrZx4IY1IgU</a></p>
<p>To see Matt acknowledge this shift in the tech stack has me really excited and it confirms that JavaScript is exploding, and regardless of what you use to build your websites, JavaScript must be a major part of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take Every Opportunity to really beef up your JavaScript Chops ‚Äî Mall Mullenweg, Creator of WordPress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, I know there are many developers in the WordPress community who have been just getting by stringing together themes, jQuery plugins and Stack Overflow answers. There are many developers who feel burned, who feel it‚Äôs too hard to learn or just something they can get by without. There will always be varying degrees of JavaScript involvement in your sites, but the one constant is that the types of sites and the interactive interfaces that you make with WordPress are happening more in the browser and are requiring some level of JavaScript knowledge to get going.</p>
<p>So ‚Äî how do you learn JavaScript? My answer is always this: Build things, build things, build things!</p>
<p>And while this is a simple answer to give, and is one you will get from many experienced developers. It‚Äôs frustrating to hear, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You aren‚Äôt sure what you should build ‚Äî either from lack of ideas, or that you aren‚Äôt 100% sure what you are capable of</li>
<li>You need at least some fundamentals before you can get started!</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer is still to find a project that you are excited about, and invested in and see it through to completion. Along the way you are going to need some resources that will help you out. I‚Äôm compiling a list of resources here. This will be a living list ‚Äî if you have something that has helped you, or something you have created and would like it added, please leave a comment below and I‚Äôll get it added to the site.</p>
<p>Go forth and learn JavaScript. Will it be hard? Yes! Is everyone else smarter than you and maybe JS just isn‚Äôt for you? No! JavaScript doesn‚Äôt have a learning curve, it‚Äôs more like learning mountains. It‚Äôs hard, but push through it with nothing but hustle and repetition and you‚Äôll get it, trust me, I‚Äôve seen this with hundreds of students at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hackeryou.com/">HackerYou</a>.</p>

  <p>TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript‚Äôs features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript‚Äôs type system.</p>
<p>For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, and <code>object</code>, but it doesn‚Äôt check that you‚Äôve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.</p>
<p>This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.</p>
<p>This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing on its type system.</p>
<h2 id="Types-by-Inference"><a href="#Types-by-Inference" class="headerlink" title="Types by Inference"></a>Types by Inference</h2><p>TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">let helloWorld &#x3D; &quot;Hello World&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F;  ^ &#x3D; let helloWorld: string</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. That‚Äôs how TypeScript knows that <code>helloWorld</code> is a <code>string</code> in the above example.</p>
<p>You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="Defining-Types"><a href="#Defining-Types" class="headerlink" title="Defining Types"></a>Defining Types</h2><p>You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. However, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming). To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.</p>
<p>For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes <code>name: string</code> and <code>id: number</code>, you can write:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const user &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: &quot;Hayes&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can explicitly describe this object‚Äôs shape using an <code>interface</code> declaration:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new <code>interface</code> by using syntax like <code>: TypeName</code> after a variable declaration:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: &quot;Hayes&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If you provide an object that doesn‚Äôt match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  username: &quot;Hayes&quot;,Type &#39;&#123; username: string; id: number; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Object literal may only specify known properties, and &#39;username&#39; does not exist in type &#39;User&#39;.Type &#39;&#123; username: string; id: number; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Object literal may only specify known properties, and &#39;username&#39; does not exist in type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an interface declaration with classes:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">class UserAccount &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  constructor(name: string, id: number) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    this.name &#x3D; name;</span><br><span class="line">    this.id &#x3D; id;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; new UserAccount(&quot;Murphy&quot;, 1);Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:</p>

<p>There are already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: <code>boolean</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>object</code>, and <code>undefined</code>, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as <code>any</code> (allow anything), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/unknown-and-never"><code>unknown</code></a> (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/unknown-and-never"><code>never</code></a> (it‚Äôs not possible that this type could happen), and <code>void</code> (a function which returns <code>undefined</code> or has no return value).</p>
<p>You‚Äôll see that there are two syntaxes for building types: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?e=83#example/types-vs-interfaces">Interfaces and Types</a>. You should prefer <code>interface</code>. Use <code>type</code> when you need specific features.</p>
<h2 id="Composing-Types"><a href="#Composing-Types" class="headerlink" title="Composing Types"></a>Composing Types</h2><p>With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with Unions, and with Generics.</p>
<h3 id="Unions"><a href="#Unions" class="headerlink" title="Unions"></a>Unions</h3><p>With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. For example, you can describe a <code>boolean</code> type as being either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type MyBool &#x3D; true | false;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you hover over <code>MyBool</code> above, you‚Äôll see that it is classed as <code>boolean</code>. That‚Äôs a property of the Structural Type System. More on this below.</p>
<p>A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of <code>string</code>s or <code>number</code>s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/literal-types.html">literal</a> that a value is allowed to be:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type WindowStates &#x3D; &quot;open&quot; | &quot;closed&quot; | &quot;minimized&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">type LockStates &#x3D; &quot;locked&quot; | &quot;unlocked&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">type OddNumbersUnderTen &#x3D; 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Unions provide a way to handle different types too. For example, you may have a function that takes an <code>array</code> or a <code>string</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function getLength(obj: string | string[]) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  return obj.length;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>To learn the type of a variable, use <code>typeof</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Type</th>
<th align="left">Predicate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">string</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof s === &quot;string&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">number</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof n === &quot;number&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">boolean</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof b === &quot;boolean&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">undefined</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof undefined === &quot;undefined&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">function</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof f === &quot;function&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">array</td>
<td align="left"><code>Array.isArray(a)</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For example, you can make a function return different values depending on whether it is passed a string or an array:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function wrapInArray(obj: string | string[]) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  if (typeof obj &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;string&quot;) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return [obj];&#x2F;&#x2F;          ^ &#x3D; (parameter) obj: string</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  &#125; else &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return obj;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="Generics"><a href="#Generics" class="headerlink" title="Generics"></a>Generics</h3><p>Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type StringArray &#x3D; Array&lt;string&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">type NumberArray &#x3D; Array&lt;number&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">type ObjectWithNameArray &#x3D; Array&lt;&#123; name: string &#125;&gt;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can declare your own types that use generics:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface Backpack&lt;Type&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  add: (obj: Type) &#x3D;&gt; void;</span><br><span class="line">  get: () &#x3D;&gt; Type;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F; This line is a shortcut to tell TypeScript there is a</span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F; constant called &#96;backpack&#96;, and to not worry about where it came from.</span><br><span class="line">declare const backpack: Backpack&lt;string&gt;;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F; object is a string, because we declared it above as the variable part of Backpack.</span><br><span class="line">const object &#x3D; backpack.get();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F; Since the backpack variable is a string, you can&#39;t pass a number to the add function.</span><br><span class="line">backpack.add(23);Argument of type &#39;number&#39; is not assignable to parameter of type &#39;string&#39;.Argument of type &#39;number&#39; is not assignable to parameter of type &#39;string&#39;.Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Structural-Type-System"><a href="#Structural-Type-System" class="headerlink" title="Structural Type System"></a>Structural Type System</h2><p>One of TypeScript‚Äôs core principles is that type checking focuses on the <em>shape</em> that values have. This is sometimes called ‚Äúduck typing‚Äù or ‚Äústructural typing‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface Point &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  x: number;</span><br><span class="line">  y: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">function logPoint(p: Point) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  console.log(&#96;$&#123;p.x&#125;, $&#123;p.y&#125;&#96;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F; logs &quot;12, 26&quot;</span><br><span class="line">const point &#x3D; &#123; x: 12, y: 26 &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">logPoint(point);Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <code>point</code> variable is never declared to be a <code>Point</code> type. However, TypeScript compares the shape of <code>point</code> to the shape of <code>Point</code> in the type-check. They have the same shape, so the code passes.</p>
<p>The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object‚Äôs fields to match.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const point3 &#x3D; &#123; x: 12, y: 26, z: 89 &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">logPoint(point3); &#x2F;&#x2F; logs &quot;12, 26&quot;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const rect &#x3D; &#123; x: 33, y: 3, width: 30, height: 80 &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">logPoint(rect); &#x2F;&#x2F; logs &quot;33, 3&quot;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const color &#x3D; &#123; hex: &quot;#187ABF&quot; &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">logPoint(color);Argument of type &#39;&#123; hex: string; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to parameter of type &#39;Point&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Type &#39;&#123; hex: string; &#125;&#39; is missing the following properties from type &#39;Point&#39;: x, yArgument of type &#39;&#123; hex: string; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to parameter of type &#39;Point&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Type &#39;&#123; hex: string; &#125;&#39; is missing the following properties from type &#39;Point&#39;: x, yTry</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">class VirtualPoint &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  x: number;</span><br><span class="line">  y: number;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  constructor(x: number, y: number) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    this.x &#x3D; x;</span><br><span class="line">    this.y &#x3D; y;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const newVPoint &#x3D; new VirtualPoint(13, 56);</span><br><span class="line">logPoint(newVPoint); &#x2F;&#x2F; logs &quot;13, 56&quot;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If the object or class has all the required properties, TypeScript will say they match, regardless of the implementation details.</p>

  <p>Is React hard to learn? Is React easy to learn? Well, it depends on your approach.</p>
<p>This here is your timeline for learning React. Think of these steps as layers in a foundation.</p>
<p>If you were building a house, would you skip some steps to get it done faster? Maybe jump right to pouring the concrete before laying some rocks down? Start building the walls on bare earth?</p>
<p>Or how about making a wedding cake: the top part looks the most fun to decorate, so why not start there! Just figure out the bottom part later.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Of course not. You know those things would lead to failure.</p>
<p>So why does the standard approach to learning React involve trying to learn ES6 + Webpack + Babel + Redux + Routing + AJAX + React <em>all at once</em>? Sounds like a surefire path to overwhelm (and giving up)!</p>
<p>So I‚Äôve laid out a timeline. Take these one step at a time. Do not skip steps. Do not learn 2 steps at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="So-How-Long-Does-it-Take-To-Learn-React"><a href="#So-How-Long-Does-it-Take-To-Learn-React" class="headerlink" title="So How Long Does it Take To Learn React?"></a>So How Long Does it Take To Learn React?</h2><p>The thing is, everyone starts from a different place. You‚Äôll have a different set of knowledge coming in than I did, or than the people on Twitter do, or than your coworkers did. So it‚Äôs really hard to give specific timelines.</p>
<p>My own path was something like: programming as a kid, did programming in high school, got a CS degree with bachelors and masters, worked 4-5 years doing low-level C/C++ development, then worked 2 years with JS &amp; jQuery &amp; Java, then a year or so with AngularJS (1.x), and then learning the basics of React took a few days.</p>
<p>If your background is different, it‚Äôll take you a different amount of time. If you‚Äôre starting to learn programming at the same time you‚Äôre learning React, it will take longer, and that‚Äôs fine. That‚Äôs normal and expected.</p>
<p>The theme of the strategy I‚Äôll lay out below is to <strong>avoid getting overwhelmed</strong>. Slow and steady, uh, learns the React ;)</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a big believer in giving yourself tiny wins along the way. It makes the process more fun, and makes the learning go faster, too. So whichever step you‚Äôre on, try to break the project or exercise or tutorial into small pieces that you can complete to get yourself a little win. Celebrate it.</p>
<p>Always keep in mind that you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/your-own-react-project-ideas/">minimize or simplify</a> a problem from the stated one. Choose your own difficulty setting. And if you run out of ideas, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/learn-react-with-copywork/">copy stuff that exists</a>. It‚Äôs a great way to learn.</p>
<h2 id="Step-0-JavaScript"><a href="#Step-0-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Step 0: JavaScript"></a>Step 0: JavaScript</h2><p>Do you need to know JavaScript before you learn React? And how much JavaScript should you know?</p>
<p>Well, JS is Step 0 for a reason. It‚Äôll be hard to learn React without knowing a decent amount of JavaScript, because a lot of React‚Äôs syntax is in fact regular JavaScript.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll want to have a good handle on things like‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>how <code>this</code> works (particularly how the current scope affects the value of <code>this</code>)</li>
<li>function scope vs block scope</li>
<li>control structures like <code>if</code> and <code>switch</code></li>
<li>how to write and call functions</li>
<li>how to create and access objects and arrays</li>
<li>functional features, especially <code>Array.map</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs not an exhaustive list but I think if you can do those things, you can start playing with React in small experimental apps. I‚Äôd highly recommend against trying to build a complicated piece of software (like that SaaS app you‚Äôve been dreaming of) as your first outing. Big apps are bad learning projects. Get a few tiny apps (e.g. a few hours, a day, a weekend) under your belt first.</p>
<p>With prior programming experience, JS probably won‚Äôt take you too long to pick up. It has some quirks ‚Äì scoping of <code>this</code> is particularly quirky ‚Äì but it‚Äôs a C-like language so if you‚Äôre used to one of those you should be all set.</p>
<p>Here is a good series of books called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don‚Äôt Know JS</a>. They‚Äôre free to read online.</p>
<p>The latest versions of React have phased out their usage of ES5 and the old <code>createClass</code> way of making components ‚Äì it‚Äôs all ES6 classes now. But outside of those, there isn‚Äôt too much ES6-specific syntax that‚Äôs absolutely required. Learn it as you go.</p>
<h2 id="Step-0-5-NPM-or-Yarn"><a href="#Step-0-5-NPM-or-Yarn" class="headerlink" title="Step 0.5: NPM (or Yarn)"></a>Step 0.5: NPM (or Yarn)</h2><p>In order to use React and friends, you‚Äôll need a package manager.</p>
<p>NPM and Yarn are the big two package managers of the JavaScript world. There isn‚Äôt too much to learn here. When you <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nodejs.org/">install Node.js</a> it comes bundled with NPM. Afer that, all you really need to know is how to install packages (<code>npm install &lt;package name&gt;</code>).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> is a more recent package manager and gives some nice improvements over NPM, chief of which is speed of installation. I use Yarn almost exclusively for that reason.</p>
<p>Every package is available through NPM or with Yarn ‚Äì there are no exclusivity contracts here ;) So try both and pick your favorite.</p>
<h2 id="Step-1-React"><a href="#Step-1-React" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: React"></a>Step 1: React</h2><p>Start with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/test-drive-react/">Hello World</a>. Use either a plain HTML file with some <code>script</code> tags ala the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html">official tutorial</a> or use a tool like React Heatpack to get you up and running quickly.</p>
<p>Try out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/test-drive-react/">Hello World in 3 minutes</a> tutorial!</p>
<h2 id="Step-2-Build-a-Few-Things-and-Throw-Them-Away"><a href="#Step-2-Build-a-Few-Things-and-Throw-Them-Away" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Build a Few Things, and Throw Them Away"></a>Step 2: Build a Few Things, and Throw Them Away</h2><p>This is the awkward middle step that a lot of people skip.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt make that mistake. Moving forward without having a firm grasp of React‚Äôs concepts will lead straight back to overwhelmsville.</p>
<p>But this step isn‚Äôt very well-defined: what should you build? A prototype for work? Maybe a fancy Facebook clone, something meaty to really get used to the whole stack?</p>
<p>Well, no, not those things. They‚Äôre either loaded with baggage or too large for a learning project.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPrototypes‚Äù for work are especially terrible, because <em>you absolutely know</em> in your heart that a ‚Äúprototype‚Äù will be nothing of the sort. It will live long beyond the prototype phase, morph into shipping software, and never be thrown away or rewritten.</p>
<p>Using a work ‚Äúprototype‚Äù as a learning project is problematic because you‚Äôre likely to get all worked up about the <em>future</em>. Because you <em>know</em> it‚Äôll be more than just a prototype, you start to worry ‚Äì shouldn‚Äôt it have tests? I should make sure the architecture will scale‚Ä¶ Am I going to have to refactor this mess later? And shouldn‚Äôt it have tests?</p>
<p>This specific problem is what I cover in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/pure-react/?_r=timeline">Pure React</a>: once you get past ‚ÄúHello World,‚Äù how do you learn to ‚Äúthink in React?‚Äù</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the gist: the ideal projects are somewhere between ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll of Twitter.‚Äù</p>
<p>Build some lists of things (TODOs, beers, movies). Learn how the data flow works. For some ideas try this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/">list of React practice projects</a> or if you‚Äôre into music try <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/build-metronome-react/">building a little metronome</a>.</p>
<p>Take some existing large UIs (Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, etc) and break off a small chunk to build ‚Äì carve it up into components, build the pieces, and render it with static data. ‚ÄúCopywork‚Äù is the practice of recreating existing apps as a way of improving your skills and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/learn-react-with-copywork/">copywork is a great way to learn React</a>.</p>
<p>You get the idea: small, throwaway apps. They <em>must be throwaways</em> otherwise you‚Äôll get hung up on maintainability and architecture and other crap that just doesn‚Äôt matter yet.</p>
<p>I wrote <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/pure-react/?_r=timeline">Pure React</a> to teach this way because there‚Äôs not much else out there that takes the bite-size approach.</p>
<h3 id="React-is-Hard"><a href="#React-is-Hard" class="headerlink" title="React is Hard"></a>React is Hard</h3><p>Before you go too much further I just want to be straight with you. Learning React is gonna be tough. You will struggle at first, and that is <em>TOTALLY NORMAL</em>. The only way out is through: keep building tiny things until the concepts sink in.</p>
<p>Practice is super important. <em>Building apps</em>, even (especially) tiny ones is super important. Don‚Äôt just read tutorials and watch videos. Learning React (or anything, really) is not a linear process. It does not go like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>read/watch tutorials until it makes sense</li>
<li>build a great app</li>
</ol>
<p>The fastest path is (counterintuitively) more like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>read/watch just <em>one</em> tutorial</li>
<li>try out what you just learned</li>
<li>make some mistakes, re-read, fix them, try again</li>
<li>try it on your own again</li>
<li>success! tiny win! back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>So keep that in mind as you‚Äôre working through this stuff. It‚Äôs hard. It will get easier, but it will suck for a while, and you‚Äôre not stupid or foolish for struggling. Everybody struggles! ‚ÄúProgramming is suffering.‚Äù At least I think that was the quote.</p>
<h2 id="Step-3-Webpack"><a href="#Step-3-Webpack" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Webpack"></a>Step 3: Webpack</h2><p>Build tools are a major stumbling block. Setting up Webpack feels like stumbling through a dark cave the first few times, and it‚Äôs a whole different mindset from writing UI code. This is why Webpack is down at Step 3, instead of Step 0.</p>
<p>I recommend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/webpack-the-confusing-parts-58712f8fcad9">Webpack ‚Äì The Confusing Parts</a> as an introduction to Webpack and its way of thinking.</p>
<p>Once you understand what it does (bundles <em>every kind of file</em>, not just JS) ‚Äì and how it works (loaders for each file type), the Webpack part of your life will be much happier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can just avoid it by sticking with Create React App. It‚Äôs an awesome tool for development, and it‚Äôs even well-suited to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/deploy-create-react-app-surge/">build and deploy your React app to production</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Step-4-ES6"><a href="#Step-4-ES6" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: ES6"></a>Step 4: ES6</h2><p>Now that you‚Äôre in Step 4, you have all those steps above as <em>context</em>. The bits of ES6 you learn now will help you write cleaner, better code ‚Äì and faster. If you tried to memorize it all in the beginning, it wouldn‚Äôt have stuck ‚Äì but now, you know how it all fits in.</p>
<p>Learn the parts you‚Äôll use most: arrow functions, let/const, classes, destructuring, and <code>import</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Step-5-Routing"><a href="#Step-5-Routing" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Routing"></a>Step 5: Routing</h2><p>Some people conflate React Router and Redux in their head ‚Äì they‚Äôre not related or dependent on each other. You can (and should!) learn to use React Router before diving into Redux.</p>
<p>By this point you‚Äôll have a solid foundation in ‚Äúthinking in React,‚Äù and React Router‚Äôs component-based approach will make more sense than if you‚Äôd tackled it on Day 1.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6-Redux"><a href="#Step-6-Redux" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Redux"></a>Step 6: Redux</h2><p>Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-makes-you-sad">will tell you</a> not to add Redux too early, and for good reason ‚Äì it‚Äôs a dose of complexity that can be disastrous early on.</p>
<p>The concepts behind Redux are simple in isolation. But there is a mental leap from understanding the pieces to knowing how to use them in an app.</p>
<p>So, repeat what you did in Step 2: build disposable apps. Build a bunch of little Redux experiements to really internalize how it works.</p>
<h2 id="Non-steps"><a href="#Non-steps" class="headerlink" title="Non-steps"></a>Non-steps</h2><p>There are a few bits of ‚Äúcommon wisdom‚Äù that will torpedo your progress pretty quickly. Boilerplate projects, for one.</p>
<p>Diving into React by picking one of the bajillion boilerplate projects out there will only confuse you. They include every possible library, and force a directory structure upon you ‚Äì and neither of these are required for smaller apps, or when you‚Äôre getting started.</p>
<p>It <em>seems</em> logical to start with a solid foundation in the form of a boilerplate that enforces best practices ‚Äì but it‚Äôs a ton of complexity right up front that will make React &amp; the related libraries harder to learn than if you tackled them one-by-one.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúBut Dave I‚Äôm not building a small app, I‚Äôm building a complex app that will serve millions of users!‚Äù‚Ä¶ go re-read that bit about prototypes ;)</p>
<h2 id="How-to-tackle-this"><a href="#How-to-tackle-this" class="headerlink" title="How to tackle this"></a>How to tackle this</h2><p>This is a lot to take in. It‚Äôs a lot to learn ‚Äì but there‚Äôs a logical progression. One foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>Remember: it‚Äôll be tough at first. Everybody struggles with this. Frontend development is complicated. But you can work through it! Tiny apps. Tiny wins. Lots of practice. It will all add up to understanding the entire stack and being able to build whatever you can imagine.</p>

  <p>Hey, I got this new web project, but to be honest I haven‚Äôt coded much web in a few years and I‚Äôve heard the landscape changed a bit. You are the most up-to date web dev around here right?</p>
<p><em>-The actual term is Front End engineer, but yeah, I‚Äôm the right guy. I do web in 2016. Visualisations, music players, flying drones that play football, you name it. I just came back from JsConf and ReactConf, so I know the latest technologies to create web apps.</em></p>
<p>Cool. I need to create a page that displays the latest activity from the users, so I just need to get the data from the REST endpoint and display it in some sort of filterable table, and update it if anything changes in the server. I was thinking maybe using jQuery to fetch and display the data?</p>
<p><em>-Oh my god no, no one uses jQuery anymore. You should try learning React, it‚Äôs 2016.</em></p>
<p>Oh, OK. What‚Äôs React?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs a super cool library made by some guys at Facebook, it really brings control and performance to your application, by allowing you to handle any view changes very easily.</em></p>
<p>That sounds neat. Can I use React to display data from the server?</p>
<p><em>-Yeah, but first you need to add React and React DOM as a library in your webpage.</em></p>
<p>Wait, why two libraries?</p>
<p><em>-So one is the actual library and the second one is for manipulating the DOM, which now you can describe in JSX.</em></p>
<p>JSX? What is JSX?</p>
<p><em>-JSX is just a JavaScript syntax extension that looks pretty much like XML. It‚Äôs kind of another way to describe the DOM, think of it as a better HTML.</em></p>
<p>What‚Äôs wrong with HTML?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs 2016. No one codes HTML directly anymore.</em></p>
<p>Right. Anyway, if I add these two libraries then I can use React?</p>
<p><em>-Not quite. You need to add Babel, and then you are able to use React.</em></p>
<p>Another library? What‚Äôs Babel?</p>
<p><em>-Oh, Babel is a transpiler that allows you to target specific versions of JavaScript, while you code in any version of JavaScript. You don‚Äôt HAVE to include Babel to use ReactJS, but unless you do, you are stuck with using ES5, and let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs 2016, you should be coding in ES2016+ like the rest of the cool kids do.</em></p>
<p>ES5? ES2016+? I‚Äôm getting lost over here. What‚Äôs ES5 and ES2016+?</p>
<p><em>-ES5 stands for ECMAScript 5. It‚Äôs the edition that has most people target since it has been implemented by most browsers nowadays.</em></p>
<p>ECMAScript?</p>
<p><em>-Yes, you know, the scripting standard JavaScript was based on in 1999 after its initial release in 1995, back then when JavaScript was named Livescript and only ran in the Netscape Navigator. That was very messy back then, but thankfully now things are very clear and we have, like, 7 editions of this implementation.</em></p>
<p>7 editions. For real. And ES5 and ES2016+ are?</p>
<p><em>-The fifth and seventh edition respectively.</em></p>
<p>Wait, what happened with the sixth?</p>
<p><em>-You mean ES6? Yeah, I mean, each edition is a superset of the previous one, so if you are using ES2016+, you are using all the features of the previous versions.</em></p>
<p>Right. And why use ES2016+ over ES6 then?</p>
<p><em>-Well, you COULD use ES6, but to use cool features like async and await, you need to use ES2016+. Otherwise you are stuck with ES6 generators with coroutines to block asynchronous calls for proper control flow.</em></p>
<p>I have no idea what you just said, and all these names are confusing. Look, I‚Äôm just loading a bunch of data from a server, I used to be able to just include jQuery from a CDN and just get the data with AJAX calls, why can‚Äôt I just do that?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs 2016 man, no one uses jQuery anymore, it ends up in a bunch of spaghetti code. Everyone knows that.</em></p>
<p>Right. So my alternative is to load three libraries to fetch data and display a HTML table.</p>
<p><em>-Well, you include those three libraries but bundle them up with a module manager to load only one file.</em></p>
<p>I see. And what‚Äôs a module manager?</p>
<p><em>-The definition depends on the environment, but in the web we usually mean anything that supports AMD or CommonJS modules.</em></p>
<p>Riiight. And AMD and CommonJS are‚Ä¶?</p>
<p><em>-Definitions. There are ways to describe how multiple JavaScript libraries and classes should interact. You know, exports and requires? You can write multiple JavaScript files defining the AMD or CommonJS API and you can use something like Browserify to bundle them up.</em></p>
<p>OK, that makes sense‚Ä¶ I think. What is Browserify?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs a tool that allows you to bundle CommonJS described dependencies to files that can be run in the browser. It was created because most people publish those dependencies in the npm registry.</em></p>
<p>npm registry?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs a very big public repository where smart people put code and dependencies as modules.</em></p>
<p>Like a CDN?</p>
<p><em>-Not really. It‚Äôs more like a centralised database where anyone can publish and download libraries, so you can use them locally for development and then upload them to a CDN if you want to.</em></p>
<p>Oh, like Bower!</p>
<p><em>-Yes, but it‚Äôs 2016 now, no one uses Bower anymore.</em></p>
<p>Oh, I see‚Ä¶ so I need to download the libraries from npm then?</p>
<p><em>-Yes. So for instance, if you want to use React , you download the React module and import it in your code. You can do that for almost every popular JavaScript library.</em></p>
<p>Oh, like Angular!</p>
<p><em>-Angular is so 2015. But yes. Angular would be there, alongside VueJS or RxJS and other cool 2016 libraries. Want to learn about those?</em></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs stick with React, I‚Äôm already learning too many things now. So, if I need to use React I fetch it from this npm and then use this Browserify thing?</p>
<p><em>-Yes.</em></p>
<p>That seems overly complicated to just grab a bunch of dependencies and tie them together.</p>
<p><em>-It is, that‚Äôs why you use a task manager like Grunt or Gulp or Broccoli to automate running Browserify. Heck, you can even use Mimosa.</em></p>
<p>Grunt? Gulp? Broccoli? Mimosa? The heck are we talking about now?</p>
<p><em>-Task managers. But they are not cool anymore. We used them in like, 2015, then we used Makefiles, but now we wrap everything with Webpack.</em></p>
<p>Makefiles? I thought that was mostly used on C or C++ projects.</p>
<p><em>-Yeah, but apparently in the web we love making things complicated and then going back to the basics. We do that every year or so, just wait for it, we are going to do assembly in the web in a year or two.</em></p>
<p>Sigh. You mentioned something called Webpack?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs another module manager for the browser while being kind of a task runner as well. It‚Äôs like a better version of Browserify.</em></p>
<p>Oh, Ok. Why is it better?</p>
<p><em>-Well, maybe not better, it‚Äôs just more opinionated on how your dependencies should be tied. Webpack allows you to use different module managers, and not only CommonJS ones, so for instance native ES6 supported modules.</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôm extremely confused by this whole CommonJS/ES6 thing.</p>
<p><em>-Everyone is, but you shouldn‚Äôt care anymore with SystemJS.</em></p>
<p>Jesus christ, another noun-js. Ok, and what is this SystemJS?</p>
<p><em>-Well, unlike Browserify and Webpack 1.x, SystemJS is a dynamic module loader that allows you to tie multiple modules in multiple files instead of bundling them in one big file.</em></p>
<p>Wait, but I thought we wanted to build our libraries in one big file and load that!</p>
<p><em>-Yes, but because HTTP/2 is coming now multiple HTTP requests are actually better.</em></p>
<p>Wait, so can‚Äôt we just add the three original libraries for React??</p>
<p><em>-Not really. I mean, you could add them as external scripts from a CDN, but you would still need to include Babel then.</em></p>
<p>Sigh. And that is bad right?</p>
<p><em>-Yes, you would be including the entire babel-core, and it wouldn‚Äôt be efficient for production. On production you need to perform a series of pre-tasks to get your project ready that make the ritual to summon Satan look like a boiled eggs recipe. You need to minify assets, uglify them, inline css above the fold, defer scripts, as well as-</em></p>
<p>I got it, I got it. So if you wouldn‚Äôt include the libraries directly in a CDN, how would you do it?</p>
<p><em>-I would transpile it from Typescript using a Webpack + SystemJS + Babel combo.</em></p>
<p>Typescript? I thought we were coding in JavaScript!</p>
<p><em>-Typescript IS JavaScript, or better put, a superset of JavaScript, more specifically JavaScript on version ES6. You know, that sixth version we talked about before?</em></p>
<p>I thought ES2016+ was already a superset of ES6! WHY we need now this thing called Typescript?</p>
<p><em>-Oh, because it allows us to use JavaScript as a typed language, and reduce run-time errors. It‚Äôs 2016, you should be adding some types to your JavaScript code.</em></p>
<p>And Typescript obviously does that.</p>
<p><em>-Flow as well, although it only checks for typing while Typescript is a superset of JavaScript which needs to be compiled.</em></p>
<p>Sigh‚Ä¶ and Flow is?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs a static type checker made by some guys at Facebook. They coded it in OCaml, because functional</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming"><em>programming</em></a> <em>is awesome.</em></p>
<p>OCaml? Functional programming?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs what the cool kids use nowadays man, you know, 2016? Functional programming? High order functions? Currying? Pure functions?</em></p>
<p>I have no idea what you just said.</p>
<p><em>-No one does at the beginning. Look, you just need to know that functional programming is better than OOP and that‚Äôs what we should be using in 2016.</em></p>
<p>Wait, I learned OOP in college, I thought that was good?</p>
<p><em>-So was Java before being bought by Oracle. I mean, OOP was good back in the days, and it still has its uses today, but now everyone is realising modifying states is equivalent to kicking babies, so now everyone is moving to immutable objects and functional programming. Haskell guys had been calling it for years, -and don‚Äôt get me started with the Elm guys- but luckily in the web now we have libraries like Ramda that allow us to use functional programming in plain JavaScript.</em></p>
<p>Are you just dropping names for the sake of it? What the hell is Ramnda?</p>
<p><em>-No. Ramda. Like Lambda. You know, that David Chambers‚Äô library?</em></p>
<p>David who?</p>
<p><em>-David Chambers. Cool guy. Plays a mean Coup game. One of the contributors for Ramda. You should also check Erik Meijer if you are serious about learning functional programming.</em></p>
<p>And Erik Meijer is‚Ä¶?</p>
<p><em>-Functional programming guy as well. Awesome guy. He has a bunch of presentations where he trashes Agile while using this weird coloured shirt. You should also check some of the stuff from Tj, Jash Kenas, Sindre Sorhus, Paul Irish, Addy Osmani-</em></p>
<p>Ok. I‚Äôm going to stop you there. All that is good and fine, but I think all that is just so complicated and unnecessary for just fetching data and displaying it. I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt need to know these people or learn all those things to create a table with dynamic data. Let‚Äôs get back to React. How can I fetch the data from the server with React?</p>
<p><em>-Well, you actually don‚Äôt fetch the data with React, you just display the data with React.</em></p>
<p>Oh, damn me. So what do you use to fetch the data?</p>
<p><em>-You use Fetch to fetch the data from the server.</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôm sorry? You use Fetch to fetch the data? Whoever is naming those things needs a thesaurus.</p>
<p><em>-I know right? Fetch it‚Äôs the name of the native implementation for performing XMLHttpRequests against a server.</em></p>
<p>Oh, so AJAX.</p>
<p><em>-AJAX is just the use of XMLHttpRequests. But sure. Fetch allows you to do AJAX based in promises, which then you can resolve to avoid the callback hell.</em></p>
<p>Callback hell?</p>
<p><em>-Yeah. Every time you perform an asynchronous request against the server, you need to wait for its response, which then makes you to add a function within a function, which is called the callback pyramid from hell.</em></p>
<p>Oh, Ok. And this promise thing solves it?</p>
<p><em>-Indeed. By manipulating your callbacks through promises, you can write easier to understand code, mock and test them, as well as perform simultaneous requests at once and wait until all of them are loaded.</em></p>
<p>And that can be done with Fetch?</p>
<p><em>-Yes, but only if your user uses an evergreen browser, otherwise you need to include a Fetch polyfill or use Request, Bluebird or Axios.</em></p>
<p>How many libraries do I need to know for god‚Äôs sake? How many are of them?</p>
<p><em>-It‚Äôs JavaScript. There has to be thousands of libraries that all do the same thing. We know libraries, in fact, we have the best libraries. Our libraries are huuuge, and sometimes we include pictures of Guy Fieri in them.</em></p>
<p>Did you just say Guy Fieri? Let‚Äôs get this over with. What these Bluebird, Request, Axios libraries do?</p>
<p><em>-They are libraries to perform XMLHttpRequests that return promises.</em></p>
<p>Didn‚Äôt jQuery‚Äôs AJAX method start to return promises as well?</p>
<p><em>-We don‚Äôt use the ‚ÄúJ‚Äù word in 2016 anymore. Just use Fetch, and polyfill it when it‚Äôs not in a browser or use Bluebird, Request or Axios instead. Then manage the promise with await within an async function and boom, you have proper control flow.</em></p>
<p>It‚Äôs the third time you mention await but I have no idea what it is.</p>
<p><em>-Await allows you to block an asynchronous call, allowing you to have better control on when the data is being fetch and overall increasing code readability. It‚Äôs awesome, you just need to make sure you add the stage-3 preset in Babel, or use syntax-async-functions and transform-async-to-generator plugin.</em></p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p><em>-No, insane is the fact you need to precompile Typescript code and then transpile it with Babel to use await.</em></p>
<p>Wat? It‚Äôs not included in Typescript?</p>
<p><em>-It does in the next version, but as of version 1.7 it only targets ES6, so if you want to use await in the browser, first you need to compile your Typescript code targeting ES6 and then Babel that shit up to target ES5.</em></p>
<p>At this point I don‚Äôt know what to say.</p>
<p><em>-Look, it‚Äôs easy. Code everything in Typescript. All modules that use Fetch compile them to target ES6, transpile them with Babel on a stage-3 preset, and load them with SystemJS. If you don‚Äôt have Fetch, polyfill it, or use Bluebird, Request or Axios, and handle all your promises with await.</em></p>
<p>We have very different definitions of easy. So, with that ritual I finally fetched the data and now I can display it with React right?</p>
<p><em>-Is your application going to handle any state changes?</em></p>
<p>Err, I don‚Äôt think so. I just need to display the data.</p>
<p><em>-Oh, thank god. Otherwise I would had to explain you Flux, and implementations like Flummox, Alt, Fluxible. Although to be honest you should be using Redux.</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to just fly over those names. Again, I just need to display data.</p>
<p><em>-Oh, if you are just displaying the data you didn‚Äôt need React to begin with. You would had been fine with a templating engine.</em></p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Do you think this is funny? Is that how you treat your loved ones?</p>
<p><em>-I was just explaining what you could use.</em></p>
<p>Stop. Just stop.</p>
<p><em>-I mean, even if it‚Äôs just using templating engine, I would still use a Typescript + SystemJS + Babel combo if I were you.</em></p>
<p>I need to display data on a page, not perform Sub Zero‚Äôs original MK fatality. Just tell me what templating engine to use and I‚Äôll take it from there.</p>
<p><em>-There‚Äôs a lot, which one you are familiar with?</em></p>
<p>Ugh, can‚Äôt remember the name. It was a long time ago.</p>
<p><em>-jTemplates? jQote? PURE?</em></p>
<p>Err, doesn‚Äôt ring a bell. Another one?</p>
<p><em>-Transparency? JSRender? MarkupJS? KnockoutJS? That one had two-way binding.</em></p>
<p>Another one?</p>
<p><em>-PlatesJS? jQuery-tmpl? Handlebars? Some people still use it.</em></p>
<p>Maybe. Are there similar to that last one?</p>
<p><em>-Mustache, underscore? I think now even lodash has one to be honest, but those are kind of 2014.</em></p>
<p>Err.. maybe it was newer.</p>
<p><em>-Jade? DustJS?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>-DotJS? EJS?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>-Nunjucks? ECT?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>-Mah, no one likes Coffeescript syntax anyway. Jade?</em></p>
<p>No, you already said Jade.</p>
<p><em>-I meant Pug. I meant Jade. I mean, Jade is now Pug.</em></p>
<p>Sigh. No. Can‚Äôt remember. Which one would you use?</p>
<p><em>-Probably just ES6 native template strings.</em></p>
<p>Let me guess. And that requires ES6.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, depending on what browser I‚Äôm using needs Babel.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, if I want to include without adding the entire core library, I need to load it as a module from npm.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, requires Browserify, or Wepback, or most likely that other thing called SystemJS.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, unless it‚Äôs Webpack, ideally should be managed by a task runner.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>But, since I should be using functional programming and typed languages I first need to pre-compile Typescript or add this Flow thingy.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>And then send that to Babel if I want to use await.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>So I can then use Fetch, promises, and control flow and all that magic.</p>
<p><em>-Just don‚Äôt forget to polyfill Fetch if it‚Äôs not supported, Safari still can‚Äôt handle it.</em></p>
<p>You know what. I think we are done here. Actually, I think I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm done with the web, I‚Äôm done with JavaScript altogether.</p>
<p><em>-That‚Äôs fine, in a few years we all are going to be coding in Elm or WebAssembly.</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôm just going to move back to the backend. I just can‚Äôt handle these many changes and versions and editions and compilers and transpilers. The JavaScript community is insane if it thinks anyone can keep up with this.</p>
<p><em>-I hear you. You should try the Python community then.</em></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><em>-Ever heard of Python 3?</em></p>

  <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>A lot of programmers that make some of the coolest and most  useful software today, such as many of the stuff we see on the Internet  or use daily, don‚Äôt have a theoretical computer science background.  They‚Äôre still pretty awesome and creative programmers and we thank them  for what they build.</p>
<p>However, theoretical computer science has its uses and  applications and can turn out to be quite practical. In this article,  targeted at programmers who know their art but who don‚Äôt have any  theoretical computer science background, I will present one of the most  pragmatic tools of computer science: Big O notation and algorithm  complexity analysis. As someone who has worked both in a computer  science academic setting and in building production-level software in  the industry, this is the tool I have found to be one of the truly  useful ones in practice, so I hope after reading this article you can  apply it in your own code to make it better. After reading this post,  you should be able to understand all the common terms computer  scientists use such as ‚Äúbig O‚Äù, ‚Äúasymptotic behavior‚Äù and ‚Äúworst-case  analysis‚Äù.</p>
<p>This text is also targeted at the junior high school and high school students from Greece or anywhere else internationally competing  in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics">International Olympiad in Informatics</a>, an algorithms competition for students, or other similar competitions.  As such, it does not have any mathematical prerequisites and will give  you the background you need in order to continue studying algorithms  with a firmer understanding of the theory behind them. As someone who  used to compete in these student competitions, I highly advise you to  read through this whole introductory material and try to fully  understand it, because it will be necessary as you study algorithms and  learn more advanced techniques.</p>
<p>I believe this text will be helpful for industry programmers  who don‚Äôt have too much experience with theoretical computer science (it is a fact that some of the most inspiring software engineers never went to college). But because it‚Äôs also for students, it may at times sound a little bit like a textbook. In addition, some of the topics in this  text may seem too obvious to you; for example, you may have seen them  during your high school years. If you feel you understand them, you can  skip them. Other sections go into a bit more depth and become slightly  theoretical, as the students competing in this competition need to know  more about theoretical algorithms than the average practitioner. But  these things are still good to know and not tremendously hard to follow, so it‚Äôs likely well worth your time. As the original text was targeted  at high school students, no mathematical background is required, so  anyone with some programming experience (i.e. if you know what recursion is) will be able to follow through without any problem.</p>
<p>Throughout this article, you will find various pointers that  link you to interesting material often outside the scope of the topic  under discussion. If you‚Äôre an industry programmer, it‚Äôs likely that  you‚Äôre familiar with most of these concepts. If you‚Äôre a junior student  participating in competitions, following those links will give you clues about other areas of computer science or software engineering that you  may not have yet explored which you can look at to broaden your  interests.</p>
<p>Big O notation and algorithm complexity analysis is something a lot of industry programmers and junior students alike find hard to  understand, fear, or avoid altogether as useless. But it‚Äôs not as hard  or as theoretical as it may seem at first. Algorithm complexity is just a way to formally measure how fast a program or algorithm runs, so it  really is quite pragmatic. Let‚Äôs start by motivating the topic a little  bit.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>We already know there are tools to measure how fast a program runs. There are programs called <em>profilers</em> which measure running time in milliseconds and can help us optimize our code by spotting bottlenecks. While this is a useful tool, it isn‚Äôt  really relevant to algorithm complexity. Algorithm complexity is  something designed to compare two algorithms at the idea level ‚Äî  ignoring low-level details such as the implementation programming  language, the hardware the algorithm runs on, or the instruction set of  the given CPU. We want to compare algorithms in terms of just what they  are: Ideas of how something is computed. Counting milliseconds won‚Äôt  help us in that. It‚Äôs quite possible that a bad algorithm written in a  low-level programming language such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly</a> runs much quicker than a good algorithm written in a high-level programming language such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. So it‚Äôs time to define what a ‚Äúbetter algorithm‚Äù really is.</p>
<p>As algorithms are programs that perform just a computation,  and not other things computers often do such as networking tasks or user input and output, complexity analysis allows us to measure how fast a  program is when it performs computations. Examples of operations that  are purely <em>computational</em> include numerical <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point">floating-point operations</a> such as addition and multiplication; searching within a database that  fits in RAM for a given value; determining the path an  artificial-intelligence character will walk through in a video game so  that they only have to walk a short distance within their virtual world; or running a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">regular expression</a> pattern match on a string. Clearly, computation is ubiquitous in computer programs.</p>
<p>Complexity analysis is also a tool that allows us to explain  how an algorithm behaves as the input grows larger. If we feed it a  different input, how will the algorithm behave? If our algorithm takes 1 second to run for an input of size 1000, how will it behave if I double the input size? Will it run just as fast, half as fast, or four times  slower? In practical programming, this is important as it allows us to  predict how our algorithm will behave when the input data becomes  larger. For example, if we‚Äôve made an algorithm for a web application  that works well with 1000 users and measure its running time, using  algorithm complexity analysis we can have a pretty good idea of what  will happen once we get 2000 users instead. For algorithmic  competitions, complexity analysis gives us insight about how long our  code will run for the largest testcases that are used to test our  program‚Äôs correctness. So if we‚Äôve measured our program‚Äôs behavior for a small input, we can get a good idea of how it will behave for larger  inputs. Let‚Äôs start by a simple example: Finding the maximum element in  an array.</p>
<h2 id="Counting-instructions"><a href="#Counting-instructions" class="headerlink" title="Counting instructions"></a>Counting instructions</h2><p>In this article, I‚Äôll use various programming languages for  the examples. However, don‚Äôt despair if you don‚Äôt know a particular  programming language. Since you know programming, you should be able to  read the examples without any problem even if you aren‚Äôt familiar with  the programming language of choice, as they will be simple and I won‚Äôt  use any esoteric language features. If you‚Äôre a student competing in  algorithms competitions, you most likely work with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">C++</a>, so you should have no problem following through. In that case I recommend working on the exercises using C++ for practice.</p>
<p>The maximum element in an array can be looked up using a simple piece of code such as this piece of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/intro.html">Javascript</a> code. Given an input array A of size n:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> M = A[ <span class="number">0</span> ];</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> ( <span class="keyword">var</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; n; ++i ) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> ( A[ i ] &gt;= M ) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  	M = A[ i ];</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now, the first thing we‚Äôll do is count how many <em>fundamental instructions</em> this piece of code executes. We will only do this once and it won‚Äôt be  necessary as we develop our theory, so bear with me for a few moments as we do this. As we analyze this piece of code, we want to break it up  into simple instructions; things that can be executed by the CPU  directly - or close to that. We‚Äôll assume our processor can execute the  following operations as one instruction each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigning a value to a variable</li>
<li>Looking up the value of a particular element in an array</li>
<li>Comparing two values</li>
<li>Incrementing a value</li>
<li>Basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication</li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôll assume branching (the choice between <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> parts of code after the <code>if</code> condition has been evaluated) occurs instantly and won‚Äôt count these  instructions. In the above code, the first line of code is:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> M = A[<span class="number">0</span>]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This requires 2 instructions: One for looking up A[ 0 ] and one for assigning the value to M (we‚Äôre assuming that n is always at least 1). These two instructions  are always required by the algorithm, regardless of the value of n. The <code>for</code> loop initialization code also has to always run. This gives us two more instructions; an assignment and a comparison:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">i = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line">i &lt; n;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>These will run before the first <code>for</code> loop iteration. After each <code>for</code> loop iteration, we need two more instructions to run, an increment of i and a comparison to check if we‚Äôll stay in the loop:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">++i;</span><br><span class="line">i &lt; n;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>So, if we ignore the loop body, the number of instructions this  algorithm needs is 4 + 2n. That is, 4 instructions at the beginning of  the <code>for</code> loop and 2 instructions at the end of each iteration of which we have n. We can now define a mathematical function f( n ) that, given an n, gives us the number of instructions the algorithm needs. For an empty <code>for</code> body, we have f( n ) = 4 + 2n.</p>
<h2 id="Worst-case-analysis"><a href="#Worst-case-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Worst-case analysis"></a>Worst-case analysis</h2><p>Now, looking at the <code>for</code> body, we have an array lookup operation and a comparison that happen always:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> ( A[ i ] &gt;= M ) &#123; ...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>That‚Äôs two instructions right there. But the <code>if</code> body may run or may not run, depending on what the array values actually are. If it happens to be so that <code>A[ i ] &gt;= M</code>, then we‚Äôll run these two additional instructions ‚Äî an array lookup and an assignment:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">M = A[ i ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>But now we can‚Äôt define an f( n ) as easily, because our number of instructions doesn‚Äôt depend solely on n but also on our input. For example, for <code>A = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]</code> the algorithm will need more instructions than for <code>A = [ 4, 3, 2, 1 ]</code>. When analyzing algorithms, we often consider the worst-case scenario.  What‚Äôs the worst that can happen for our algorithm? When does our  algorithm need the most instructions to complete? In this case, it is  when we have an array in increasing order such as <code>A = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]</code>. In that case, M needs to be replaced every single time and so that yields the most  instructions. Computer scientists have a fancy name for that and they  call it <em>worst-case analysis</em>; that‚Äôs nothing more than just  considering the case when we‚Äôre the most unlucky. So, in the worst case, we have 4 instructions to run within the <code>for</code> body, so we  have f( n ) = 4 + 2n + 4n = 6n + 4. This function f, given a problem  size n, gives us the number of instructions that would be needed in the  worst-case.</p>
<h2 id="Asymptotic-behavior"><a href="#Asymptotic-behavior" class="headerlink" title="Asymptotic behavior"></a>Asymptotic behavior</h2><p>Given such a function, we have a pretty good idea of how fast an algorithm is. However, as I promised, we won‚Äôt be needing to go  through the tedious task of counting instructions in our program.  Besides, the number of actual CPU instructions needed for each  programming language statement depends on the compiler of our  programming language and on the available CPU instruction set (i.e.  whether it‚Äôs an AMD or an Intel Pentium on your PC, or a MIPS processor  on your Playstation 2) and we said we‚Äôd be ignoring that. We‚Äôll now run  our ‚Äúf‚Äù function through a ‚Äúfilter‚Äù which will help us get rid of those  minor details that computer scientists prefer to ignore.</p>
<p>In our function, 6n + 4, we have two terms: 6n and 4. In  complexity analysis we only care about what happens to the  instruction-counting function as the program input (n) grows  large. This really goes along with the previous ideas of ‚Äúworst-case  scenario‚Äù behavior: We‚Äôre interested in how our algorithm behaves when  treated badly; when it‚Äôs challenged to do something hard. Notice that  this is really useful when comparing algorithms. If an algorithm beats  another algorithm for a large input, it‚Äôs most probably true that the  faster algorithm remains faster when given an easier, smaller input. <strong>From the terms that we are considering, we‚Äôll drop all the terms that grow  slowly and only keep the ones that grow fast as n becomes larger.</strong> Clearly 4 remains a 4 as n grows larger, but 6n grows larger and larger, so it tends to matter  more and more for larger problems. Therefore, the first thing we will do is drop the 4 and keep the function as f( n ) = 6n.</p>
<p>This makes sense if you think about it, as the 4 is simply an ‚Äúinitialization constant‚Äù. Different programming languages may require a different time to set up. For example, Java needs some time to  initialize its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">virtual machine</a>. Since we‚Äôre ignoring programming language differences, it only makes sense to ignore this value.</p>
<p>The second thing we‚Äôll ignore is the constant multiplier in front of n, and so our function will become f( n ) = n. As you can see this  simplifies things quite a lot. Again, it makes some sense to drop this  multiplicative constant if we think about how different programming  languages compile. The ‚Äúarray lookup‚Äù statement in one language may  compile to different instructions in different programming languages.  For example, in C, doing <code>A[ i ]</code> does not include a check that i is within the declared array size, while in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a> it does. So, the following Pascal code:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">M := A[ i ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Is the equivalent of the following in C:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (i &gt;= <span class="number">0</span> &amp;&amp; i &lt; n) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  M = A[i];</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>So it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that different programming languages  will yield different factors when we count their instructions. In our  example in which we are using a dumb compiler for Pascal that is  oblivious of possible optimizations, Pascal requires 3 instructions for  each array access instead of the 1 instruction C requires. Dropping this factor goes along the lines of ignoring the differences between  particular programming languages and compilers and only analyzing the  idea of the algorithm itself.</p>
<p>This filter of ‚Äúdropping all factors‚Äù and of ‚Äúkeeping the largest growing term‚Äù as described above is what we call <em>asymptotic behavior</em>. So the asymptotic behavior of f( n ) = 2n + 8 is described by the  function f( n ) = n. Mathematically speaking, what we‚Äôre saying here is  that we‚Äôre interested in the limit of function f as n tends  to infinity; but if you don‚Äôt understand what that phrase formally  means, don‚Äôt worry, because this is all you need to know. (On a side  note, in a strict mathematical setting, we would not be able to drop the constants in the limit; but for computer science purposes, we want to  do that for the reasons described above.) Let‚Äôs work a couple of  examples to familiarize ourselves with the concept.</p>
<p>Let us find the asymptotic behavior of the following example  functions by dropping the constant factors and by keeping the terms that grow the fastest.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>f( n ) = 5n + 12 gives f( n ) = n.</p>
<p>By using the exact same reasoning as above.</p>
</li>
<li><p>f( n ) = 109 gives f( n ) = 1.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre dropping the multiplier 109 * 1, but we still have to put a 1 here to indicate that this function has a non-zero value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>f( n ) = n2 + 3n + 112 gives f( n ) = n2</p>
<p>Here, n2 grows larger than 3n for sufficiently large n, so we‚Äôre keeping that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>f( n ) = n3 + 1999n + 1337 gives f( n ) = n3</p>
<p>Even though the factor in front of n is quite large, we can still find a large enough n so that n3 is bigger than 1999n. As we‚Äôre interested in the behavior for very large values of n, we only keep n3 (See <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>f( n ) = n + (n)^(1/2) gives f( n ) = n</p>
<p>This is so because n grows faster than (n)^(1/2)as we increase n.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Complexity"><a href="#Complexity" class="headerlink" title="Complexity"></a>Complexity</h2><p>So what this is telling us is that since we can drop all  these decorative constants, it‚Äôs pretty easy to tell the asymptotic  behavior of the instruction-counting function of a program. In fact, any program that doesn‚Äôt have any loops will have f( n ) = 1, since the  number of instructions it needs is just a constant (unless it uses  recursion; see below). Any program with a single loop which goes from 1  to n will have f( n ) = n, since it will do a constant number of instructions before the loop, a constant number of instructions  after the loop, and a constant number of instructions within the loop  which all run n times.</p>
<p>This should now be much easier and less tedious than counting individual instructions, so let‚Äôs take a look at a couple of examples  to get familiar with this. The following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> program checks to see if a particular value exists within an array A of size n:</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&lt;?php</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="variable">$exists</span> = <span class="literal">false</span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">for</span> ( <span class="variable">$i</span> = <span class="number">0</span>; <span class="variable">$i</span> &lt; n; ++<span class="variable">$i</span> ) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		<span class="keyword">if</span> ( <span class="variable">$A</span>[ <span class="variable">$i</span> ] == <span class="variable">$value</span> ) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">			<span class="variable">$exists</span> = <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line">			<span class="keyword">break</span>;</span><br><span class="line">		&#125;</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">?&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This method of searching for a value within an array is called <em>linear search</em>. This is a reasonable name, as this program has f( n ) = n (we‚Äôll define exactly what ‚Äúlinear‚Äù means in the next section). You may notice that  there‚Äôs a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù statement here that may make the program terminate  sooner, even after a single iteration. But recall that we‚Äôre interested  in the worst-case scenario, which for this program is for the array A to not contain the value. So we still have f( n ) = n.</p>
<h1 id="Rule-of-thumb"><a href="#Rule-of-thumb" class="headerlink" title="Rule of thumb"></a>Rule of thumb</h1><ol>
<li>Simple programs can be analyzed by counting the nested loops of the  program. A single loop over n items yields f( n ) = n. A loop within a  loop yields f( n ) = n^2. A loop within a loop within a loop yields f( n ) = n^3.</li>
<li>Given a series of for loops that are sequential, the slowest of them  determines the asymptotic behavior of the program. Two nested loops  followed by a single loop is asymptotically the same as the nested loops alone, because the nested loops <em>dominate</em> the simple loop.</li>
<li>Programs with a bigger Œò run slower than programs with a smaller Œò.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs easier to figure out the O-complexity of an algorithm than its Œò-complexity.</li>
<li>While all the symbols O, o, Œ©, œâ and Œò are useful at times, O is the  one used more commonly, as it‚Äôs easier to determine than Œò and more  practically useful than Œ©.</li>
<li>For competition algorithms implemented in C++, once you‚Äôve analyzed your complexity, you can get a rough estimate of how fast your program will  run by expecting it to perform about 1,000,000 operations per second,  where the operations you count are given by the asymptotic behavior  function describing your algorithm. For example, a Œò( n ) algorithm  takes about a second to process the input for n = 1,000,000.</li>
<li>Improving the asymptotic running time of a program often tremendously  increases its performance, much more than any smaller ‚Äútechnical‚Äù  optimizations such as using a faster programming language.</li>

  <p><strong>Introduction: A Guide To The Tech Tree</strong></p>
<p>What follows, which we call the Tech Tree, is a selection of works intended to describe how the world makes and uses software today, as well as an overview of how computers work and the foundational technologies required to make and use computers. The purpose of the GitHub Archive Program is to preserve open source software for future generations. This implies also preserving the knowledge of other technologies on which open-source software runs, along with a depiction of the open-source movement which brought this software into being.</p>
<p>In addition to this technical documentation, we have also included a selection of artistic, cultural, and historical works, to help describe the overall cultural context in which this archive was created, and a series of dictionaries, to aid translation into several of the world‚Äôs most widespread other languages.</p>
<p>This initial version of the Tech Tree will consist almost entirely of copies of pre-existing works, none of which were written for an unknown audience a long way into the future. As such it is not so much a guide as a collection of resources that we hope will be historically interesting and/or useful. We have tried to strike a balance between abstract/theoretical and concrete/practical work, and to provide at least an overview of the entire technical stack on which modern software engineering rests.</p>
<p>Please note that this document is currently a loose ‚Äúwish list‚Äù of works that we may like to include, which we are making public for the purpose of actively soliciting further suggestions and input, rather than a finalized register of selected works. Note also that the prospect of copying works onto microfilm in a human-readable form implies both potential copyright issues and the practical consideration of acquiring a copyable digital version of the work in question. Certain publishers (Packt, O‚ÄôReilly, Springer, and Wiley) have indicated they are happy to work with us, while the status for most other publishers and copyright holders remains indeterminate.</p>
<p>The proposed Tech Tree is loosely divided into the following sixteen sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Fundamentals of computing and the Internet:</em> the essentials of how computers work, and, at least as important to today‚Äôs world, how they are connected together into a single planetary network which includes most of the computers on Earth.</li>
<li><em>Algorithms and data structures</em>: processes, sets of rules, and methods of arranging data to solve common categories of problems in efficient ways. Metaphorically, algorithms are the intelligence in a software program, and data structures are its storage.</li>
<li><em>Compilers, assembler, and operating systems:</em> how written source code becomes the machine code which causes the electrical signals inside a computer to change in a controlled manner, and the theory of operating systems, the software which supports a computer‚Äôs basic functions and provides the fundamental, low-level functionality that all other software ultimately calls upon.</li>
<li><em>Programming languages:</em> some of the world‚Äôs most popular and widely used programming languages described in detail. While, fundamentally, any program can be written in any language, certain languages are better or worse at particular tasks.</li>
<li><em>Networking and connectivity</em>: how computers connect to one another, via physical wires and radio signals, both one-on-one and in larger networks. Includes descriptions of the structure of the global ‚Äúnetwork of networks‚Äù known as the Internet, which connects most of the computers on Earth.</li>
<li><em>Modern software development:</em> the processes and procedures of dealing with software projects, tools, and services at scale, with constant monitoring and communication, at assured levels of quality.</li>
<li><em>Modern software applications:</em> in-depth description of applications such as Web development (the Web is, essentially, that part of the Internet used to display output and receive input from human beings); scientific research and analysis; image processing; pattern recognition and generation via neural networks; software distributed across many different computers; cryptocurrencies, which can be used as a platform for trustless decentralized software; and the new field of quantum computing.</li>
<li><em>Hardware architectures:</em> the concepts, structures, and layout of computer hardware. Hardware refers to physical electronic components; hardware architecture refers to how those components are structured and connected in order to run software; and software ultimately becomes ephemeral patterns of electricity within those physical components.</li>
<li><em>Hardware development:</em> how to build simple computers from collections of electronic components, along with technical descriptions of drones, robots, and digital cameras.</li>
<li><em>Electronic components, transistors, semiconductor manufacturing</em>: those electronic components which predated computers, along with individual transistors, the component from which computers are made, and an overview of the technologies and processes of fabricating interconnected transistors at scale.</li>
<li><em>Electricity, radios, and other industrial technologies:</em> fundamental pre-computer technologies, regarding generating usable electrical power, transmitting it over wires, using it to convey information without wires over great distances via radio, and basic industrial metalworking.</li>
<li><em>Pre-industrial technologies:</em> technologies of eras which predated electricity.</li>
<li><em>Women and technology:</em> an overview of the oft-erased role of women in the development of software and other technologies.</li>
<li><em>Languages</em>: a dictionary of English along with translational dictionaries intended to help readers convert from English to Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, and Spanish, the world‚Äôs other four most-used languages.</li>
<li><em>Arts, culture, and history</em>: human histories and changing human cultures, mostly through the lens of celebrated fictional narratives written over the last 150 years.</li>
<li><em>Cultural context</em>: information about humanity at the time the Tech Tree was created; in particular, a snapshot of Wikipedia, a collectively generated repository of all sorts of information about our world. Due to Wikipedia‚Äôs enormous size, this section is provided as encoded data, like the rest of the archive, rather than as visual/readable pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first seven sections are devoted to software, the purpose and content of the GitHub Arctic Code Vault, and its uses and applications. The next five sections describe the technologies required to construct computers on which software might run. The remaining three are intended to illustrate the human context in which these technologies have been developed, the stories the cultures of our era told, the languages in which we told them, and the factual background and descriptions of the world in which we lived.</p>
<p>The Tech Tree is part of the much larger GitHub Arctic Code Vault. As such, it also includes, as an appendix, visual copies of the Guide to the GitHub Code Vault, along with an index of the archive‚Äôs fifteen thousand most significant code repositories, including brief descriptions and locations within the archive.</p>
<p>It is perhaps worth noting that our advisory board stressed that ours is likely to be the best-documented era in human history by far, so bundling the Tech Tree with the archive is likely to be more convenient than essential for its inheritors. As such, it is entirely possible ‚Äì indeed quite likely ‚Äì that its value will consist largely of providing context regarding the era and culture in which the archive was created, rather than as a source of new and unavailable knowledge, though of course there are imaginable futures in which it plays the latter role.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief summary of each section, describing both the general topics it covers, and the works the Tech Tree includes to document our current understanding of those topics.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamentals of computing and the Internet</strong></p>
<p>These books describe what computers are, from the silicon up ‚Äì electricity, transistors, binary logic, digital gates, bits, bytes, chips, ALUs, microprocessors, software ‚Äì as well as introducing what they can do. It also includes books which describe, at a high level, how computers can be connected together, and what that means. The works in question are:</p>

<p><strong>Networking and connectivity</strong></p>
<p>Computers are great, but in a way, so 20th century; it‚Äôs <em>networked</em> computers which are, at least arguably, the real technical revolution of the 21st. As such our networking protocols and technologies deserve considerable attention. We might hope our inheritors will either have long surpassed our networking, or will have the freedom to design anew rather than be shackled by all the compromises we‚Äôve needed to make for the sake of backwards compatibility but either way, hopefully they can learn something from what we‚Äôve done. Which is described by:</p>

<p><strong>Modern software development</strong></p>
<p>The line-by-line act of writing software is quite different from the team-by-team process of developing, testing, integrating, and deploying it. A few key approaches, tools, and roles are described here, including, for obvious reasons, unpacking Git itself.</p>

<p><strong>Modern software applications</strong></p>
<p>It would take a tech forest, not a tree, to even try to describe all of the uses to which software is put. However, some depictions of how individual projects and libraries are knit together into powerful networked applications seem valuable, as do overviews of e.g. virtualization, ‚Äúbig data‚Äù software, and especially machine learning.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic components, transistors, semiconductor manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>A more low-level analysis of fundamental electronic components and transistor-based circuitry, along with textbooks describing lithography and chip manufacturing. Obviously such manufacturing is essentially impossible to recreate from scratch (Moore‚Äôs lesser-known second law described how fabricator costs increase just as chip density decreases) but these works could conceivably be of historical or even practical significance.</p>

<p><strong>Women and Technology</strong></p>
<p>We believe women‚Äôs unique role in founding and shaping computing and technology deserves its own section. Women‚Äôs erasure in the field has meant there aren‚Äôt always primary sources from the original time of contribution (like books authored by women), and historians are finding that women‚Äôs contributions have been quite significant. Including this section allows us to appropriately acknowledge the work. Special thanks to Mar Hicks; many references in this section borrow from their Women in Computing course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We also include literature discussing tech‚Äôs negative impact on women.</p>

<p><strong>Languages</strong></p>
<p>Our professional linguistic advice was that, contrary to popular belief, the drift of English syntax and grammar has slowed dramatically, and barring some massive catastrophe it‚Äôs very likely that English will both survive and be largely recognizable a thousand years from now. To hedge our bets, though, we have included a ‚ÄúRosetta‚Äù guide translated into Arabic, Hindi, Spanish, and Chinese in every reel of the Archive, along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in every available written language, and will similarly include dictionaries and a couple of linguistic works here.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural context</strong></p>
<p>This section of the Tech Tree is intended to convey both useful practical information from our culture, and a depiction of what it was like at the time the archive was written. It will consist of encoded data, rather than imaged pages, largely because its centerpiece, a snapshot of Wikipedia, is far too large for the latter format.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, while not without its flaws and omissions, is the most readily available proxy for ‚Äúa written summary of our world.‚Äù Note that this section is by no means intended as a complete depiction of humanity today: as our advisors stressed, this era is likely to be the best documented in all of human history, and such information is very unlikely to be difficult to find. Rather, it is intended as a convenience to indicate to the archive‚Äôs inheritors the specific, particular context of the era in which the archive was written.</p>
<p>This section will also include several other data sources recommended by GitHub‚Äôs community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiktionary</li>
<li>Wikispecies</li>
<li>The File Formats Archive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The GitHub Arctic Code Vault</strong></p>
<p>As the Tech Tree is a companion piece to the GitHub Arctic Code Vault, it will contain an index with the name, brief description, and film reel number for all of the GitHub repositories stored in the Arctic Code Vault, i.e. every active public GitHub repo as of 02/02/2020.</p>
<p>This index will also highlight the 15,000 GitHub repositories which are the most-starred or most-depended-on at the time the archive was written. (These are also the repositories which will be stored in the two-reel ‚Äúgreatest hits‚Äù subsets of the archive, to be kept with partners such as Oxford‚Äôs Bodleian Library and others.)</p>
<p>It is worth noting that every individual reel of the Arctic Code Vault also has its own index itemizing its contents, along with all of the instructions and information required to decode the information stored in that reel. This master index will be a superset of all of those indexes, to serve as a backup and a convenience for the archive‚Äôs inheritors.</p>
