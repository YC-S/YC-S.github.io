  <p>Reaching 95%-ile isn’t very impressive because it’s not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn’t help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it’s just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.</p>
<p>Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I’m also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The “one weird trick” is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.</p>
<p>This post is going to refer to specifics since the discussions I’ve seen about this are all in the abstract, which turns them into Rorschach tests. For example, Scott Adams has a widely cited post claiming that it’s better to be a generalist than a specialist because, to become “extraordinary”, you have to either be “the best” at one thing or 75%-ile at two things. If that were strictly true, it would surely be better to be a generalist, but that’s of course exaggeration and it’s possible to get a lot of value out of a specialized skill without being “the best”; since the precise claim, as written, is obviously silly and the rest of the post is vague handwaving, discussions will inevitably devolve into people stating their prior beliefs and basically ignoring the content of the post.</p>
<p>Personally, in every activity I’ve participated in where it’s possible to get a rough percentile ranking, people who are 95%-ile constantly make mistakes that seem like they should be easy to observe and correct. “Real world” activities typically can’t be reduced to a percentile rating, but achieving what appears to be a similar level of proficiency seems similarly easy.</p>
<p>We’ll start by looking at Overwatch (a video game) in detail because it’s an activity I’m familiar with where it’s easy to get ranking information and observe what’s happening, and then we’ll look at some “real world” examples where we can observe the same phenomena, although we won’t be able to get ranking information for real world examples1.</p>
<h1 id="Overwatch"><a href="#Overwatch" class="headerlink" title="Overwatch"></a>Overwatch</h1><p>At 90%-ile and 95%-ile ranks in Overwatch, the vast majority of players will pretty much constantly make basic game losing mistakes. These are simple mistakes like standing next to the objective instead of on top of the objective while the match timer runs out, turning a probable victory into a certain defeat. See the attached footnote if you want enough detail about specific mistakes that you can decide for yourself if a mistake is “basic” or not2.</p>
<p>Some reasons we might expect this to happen are:</p>
<p>People don’t want to win or don’t care about winning<br>People understand their mistakes but haven’t put in enough time to fix them<br>People are untalented<br>People don’t understand how to spot their mistakes and fix them<br>In Overwatch, you may see a lot of (1), people who don’t seem to care about winning, at lower ranks, but by the time you get to 30%-ile, it’s common to see people indicate their desire to win in various ways, such as yelling at players who are perceived as uncaring about victory or unskilled, complaining about people who they perceive to make mistakes that prevented their team from winning, etc.3. Other than the occasional troll, it’s not unreasonable to think that people are generally trying to win when they’re severely angered by losing.</p>
<p>(2), not having put in time enough to fix their mistakes will, at some point, apply to all players who are improving, but if you look at the median time played at 50%-ile, people who are stably ranked there have put in hundreds of hours (and the median time played at higher ranks is higher). Given how simple the mistakes we’re discussing are, not having put in enough time cannot be the case for most players.</p>
<p>A common complaint among low-ranked Overwatch players in Overwatch forums is that they’re just not talented and can never get better. Most people probably don’t have the talent to play in a professional league regardless of their practice regimen, but when you can get to 95%-ile by fixing mistakes like “not realizing that you should stand on the objective”, you don’t really need a lot of talent to get to 95%-ile.</p>
<p>While (4), people not understanding how to spot and fix their mistakes, isn’t the only other possible explanation4, I believe it’s the most likely explanation for most players. Most players who express frustration that they’re stuck at a rank up to maybe 95%-ile or 99%-ile don’t seem to realize that they could drastically improve by observing their own gameplay or having someone else look at their gameplay.</p>
<p>One thing that’s curious about this is that Overwatch makes it easy to spot basic mistakes (compared to most other activities). After you’re killed, the game shows you how you died from the viewpoint of the player who killed you, allowing you to see what led to your death. Overwatch also records the entire game and lets you watch a replay of the game, allowing you to figure out what happened and why the game was won or lost. In many other games, you’d have to set up recording software to be able to view a replay.</p>
<p>If you read Overwatch forums, you’ll see a regular stream of posts that are basically “I’m SOOOOOO FRUSTRATED! I’ve played this game for 1200 hours and I’m still ranked 10%-ile, [some Overwatch specific stuff that will vary from player to player]”. Another user will inevitably respond with something like “we can’t tell what’s wrong from your text, please post a video of your gameplay”. In the cases where the original poster responds with a recording of their play, people will post helpful feedback that will immediately make the player much better if they take it seriously. If you follow these people who ask for help, you’ll often see them ask for feedback at a much higher rank (e.g., moving from 10%-ile to 40%-ile) shortly afterwards. It’s nice to see that the advice works, but it’s unfortunate that so many players don’t realize that watching their own recordings or posting recordings for feedback could have saved 1198 hours of frustration.</p>
<p>It appears to be common for Overwatch players (well into 95%-ile and above) to:</p>
<p>Want to improve<br>Not get feedback<br>Improve slowly when getting feedback would make improving quickly easy<br>Overwatch provides the tools to make it relatively easy to get feedback, but people who very strongly express a desire to improve don’t avail themselves of these tools.</p>
<h1 id="Real-life"><a href="#Real-life" class="headerlink" title="Real life"></a>Real life</h1><p>My experience is that other games are similar and I think that “real life” activities aren’t so different, although there are some complications.</p>
<p>One complication is that real life activities tend not to have a single, one-dimensional, objective to optimize for. Another is that what makes someone good at a real life activity tends to be poorly understood (by comparison to games and sports) even in relation to a specific, well defined, goal.</p>
<p>Games with rating systems are easy to optimize for: your meta-goal can be to get a high rating, which can typically be achieved by increasing your win rate by fixing the kinds of mistakes described above, like not realizing that you should step onto the objective. For any particular mistake, you can even make a reasonable guess at the impact on your win rate and therefore the impact on your rating.</p>
<p>In real life, if you want to be (for example) “a good speaker”, that might mean that you want to give informative talks that help people learn or that you want to give entertaining talks that people enjoy or that you want to give keynotes at prestigious conferences or that you want to be asked to give talks for $50k an appearance. Those are all different objectives, with different strategies for achieving them and for some particular mistake (e.g., spending 8 minutes on introducing yourself during a 20 minute talk), it’s unclear what that means with respect to your goal.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes games, at least mainstream ones, easy to optimize for is that they tend to have a lot of aficionados who have obsessively tried to figure out what’s effective. This means that if you want to improve, unless you’re trying to be among the top in the world, you can simply figure out what resources have worked for other people, pick one up, read/watch it, and then practice. For example, if you want to be 99%-ile in a trick-taking card game like bridge or spades (among all players, not subgroups like “ACBL players with masterpoints” or “people who regularly attend North American Bridge Championships”), you can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>learning the basics of the game</p>
</li>
<li><p>reading a beginner book on cardplay</p>
</li>
<li><p>practicing applying the material</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to become a good speaker and you have a specific definition of “a good speaker” in mind, there still isn’t an obvious path forward. Great speakers will give directly contradictory advice (e.g., avoid focusing on presentation skills vs. practice presentation skills). Relatively few people obsessively try to improve and figure out what works, which results in a lack of rigorous curricula for improving. However, this also means that it’s easy to improve in percentile terms since relatively few people are trying to improve at all.</p>
<p>Despite all of the caveats above, my belief is that it’s easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there’s so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities. Just for example, if you’re a local table tennis hotshot who can beat every rando at a local bar, when you challenge someone to a game and they say “sure, what’s your rating?” you know you’re in shellacking by someone who can probably beat you while playing with a shoe brush. You’re probably 99%-ile, but someone with no talent who’s put in the time to practice the basics is going to have a serve that you can’t return as well as be able to kill any shot a local bar expert is able to consitently hit. In most real life activities, there’s almost no one who puts in a level of delibrate practice equivalent to someone who goes down to their local table tennis club and practices two hours a week, let alone someone like a top pro, who might seriously train for four hours a day.</p>
<p>To give a couple of concrete examples, I helped Leah prepare for talks from 2013 to 2017. The first couple practice talks she gave were about the same as you’d expect if you walked into a random talk at a large tech conference. For the first couple years she was speaking, she did something like 30 or so practice runs for each public talk, of which I watched and gave feedback on half. Her first public talk was (IMO) well above average for a talk at a large, well regarded, tech conference and her talks got better from there until she stopped speaking in 2017.</p>
<p>As we discussed above, this is more subjective than game ratings and there’s no way to really determine a percentile, but if you look at how most people prepare for talks, it’s not too surprising that Leah was above average. At one of the first conferences she spoke at, the night before the conference, we talked to another speaker who mentioned that they hadn’t finished their talk yet and only had fifteen minutes of material (for a forty minute talk). They were trying to figure out how to fill the rest of the time. That kind of preparation isn’t unusual and the vast majority of talks prepared like that aren’t great.</p>
<p>Most people consider doing 30 practice runs for a talk to be absurd, a totally obsessive amount of practice, but I think Gary Bernhardt has it right when he says that, if you’re giving a 30-minute talk to a 300 person audience, that’s 150 person-hours watching your talk, so it’s not obviously unreasonable to spend 15 hours practicing (and 30 practice runs will probably be less than 15 hours since you can cut a number of the runs short and/or repeatedly practice problem sections). One thing to note that this level of practice, considered obessive when giving a talk, still pales in comparison to the amount of time a middling table tennis club player will spend practicing.</p>
<p>If you’ve studied pedagogy, you might say that the help I gave to Leah was incredibly lame. It’s known that having laypeople try to figure out how to improve among themselves is among the worst possible ways to learn something, good instruction is more effective and having a skilled coach or teacher give one-on-one instruction is more effective still5. That’s 100% true, my help was incredibly lame. However, most people aren’t going to practice a talk more than a couple times and many won’t even practice a single time (I don’t have great data proving this, this is from informally polling speakers at conferences I’ve attended). This makes Leah’s 30 practice runs an extraordinary amount of practice compared to most speakers, which resulted in a relatively good outcome even though we were using one of the worst possible techniques for improvement.</p>
<p>My writing is another example. I’m not going to compare myself to anyone else, but my writing improved dramatically the first couple of years I wrote this blog just because I spent a little bit of effort on getting and taking feedback.</p>
<p>Leah read one or two drafts of almost every post and gave me feedback. On the first posts, since neither one of us knew anything about writing, we had a hard time identifying what was wrong. If I had some awkward prose or confusing narrative structure, we’d be able to point at it and say “that looks wrong” without being able to describe what was wrong or suggest a fix. It was like, in the era before spellcheck, when you misspelled a word and could tell that something was wrong, but every permutation you came up with was just as wrong.</p>
<p>My fix for that was to hire a professional editor whose writing I respected with the instructions “I don’t care about spelling and grammar fixes, there are fundamental problems with my writing that I don’t understand, please explain to me what they are”6. I think this was more effective than my helping Leah with talks because we got someone who’s basically a professional coach involved. An example of something my editor helped us with was giving us a vocabulary we could use to discuss structural problems, the way design patterns gave people a vocabulary to talk about OO design.</p>
<h1 id="Back-to-this-blog’s-regularly-scheduled-topic-programming"><a href="#Back-to-this-blog’s-regularly-scheduled-topic-programming" class="headerlink" title="Back to this blog’s regularly scheduled topic: programming"></a>Back to this blog’s regularly scheduled topic: programming</h1><p>Programming is similar to the real life examples above in that it’s impossible to assign a rating or calculate percentiles or anything like that, but it is still possible to make significant improvements relative to your former self without too much effort by getting feedback on what you’re doing.</p>
<p>For example, here’s one thing Michael Malis did:</p>
<p>One incredibly useful exercise I’ve found is to watch myself program. Throughout the week, I have a program running in the background that records my screen. At the end of the week, I’ll watch a few segments from the previous week. Usually I will watch the times that felt like it took a lot longer to complete some task than it should have. While watching them, I’ll pay attention to specifically where the time went and figure out what I could have done better. When I first did this, I was really surprised at where all of my time was going.</p>
<p>For example, previously when writing code, I would write all my code for a new feature up front and then test all of the code collectively. When testing code this way, I would have to isolate which function the bug was in and then debug that individual function. After watching a recording of myself writing code, I realized I was spending about a quarter of the total time implementing the feature tracking down which functions the bugs were in! This was completely non-obvious to me and I wouldn’t have found it out without recording myself. Now that I’m aware that I spent so much time isolating which function a bugs are in, I now test each function as I write it to make sure they work. This allows me to write code a lot faster as it dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to debug my code.</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve spent time figuring out where time is going when I code and basically saw the same thing as in Overwatch, except instead of constantly making game-losing mistakes, I was constantly doing pointlessly time-losing things. Just getting rid of some of those bad habits has probably been at least a 2x productivity increase for me, pretty easy to measure since fixing these is basically just clawing back wasted time. For example, I noticed how I’d get distracted for N minutes if I read something on the internet when I needed to wait for two minutes, so I made sure to keep a queue of useful work to fill dead time (and if I was working on something very latency sensitive where I didn’t want to task switch, I’d do nothing until I was done waiting).</p>
<p>One thing to note here is that it’s important to actually track what you’re doing and not just guess at what you’re doing. When I’ve recorded what people do and compare it to what they think they’re doing, these are often quite different. It would generally be considered absurd to operate a complex software system without metrics or tracing, but it’s normal to operate yourself without metrics or tracing, even though you’re much more complex and harder to understand than the software you work on.</p>
<p>Jonathan Tang has noted that choosing the right problem dominates execution speed. I don’t disagree with that, but doubling execution speed is still decent win that’s independent of selecting the right problem to work on and I don’t think that discussing how to choose the right problem can be effectively described in the abstract and the context necessary to give examples would be much longer than the already too long Overwatch examples in this post, maybe I’ll write another post that’s just about that.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is sort of an odd post for me to write since I think that culturally, we care a bit too much about productivity in the U.S., especially in places I’ve lived recently (NYC &amp; SF). But at a personal level, higher productivity doing work or chores doesn’t have to be converted into more work or chores, it can also be converted into more vacation time or more time doing whatever you value.</p>
<p>And for games like Overwatch, I don’t think improving is a moral imperative; there’s nothing wrong with having fun at 50%-ile or 10%-ile or any rank. But in every game I’ve played with a rating and/or league/tournament system, a lot of people get really upset and unhappy when they lose even when they haven’t put much effort into improving. If that’s the case, why not put a little bit of effort into improving and spend a little bit less time being upset?</p>

<h2 id="Appendix-other-most-ridiculable-ideas"><a href="#Appendix-other-most-ridiculable-ideas" class="headerlink" title="Appendix: other most ridiculable ideas"></a>Appendix: other most ridiculable ideas</h2><p>Here are the ideas I’ve posted about that were the most widely ridiculed at the time of the post:</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for programmers at trendy tech companies to make $350k/yr or more (2015, stated number was $250k/yr at the time)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monorepos can be reasonable (2015)</p>
</li>
<li><p>We should expect to see a lot more CPU bugs (2016)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Markets are not incompatible with discrimination (2014)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Computers are getting slower in some ways (2017)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Empirical evidence on the benefit of types is almost non-existent (2014)</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s reasonable to write technical posts on a subject that avoid domain-specific terminology</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My posts on compensation have the dubious distinction of being the posts most frequently called out both for being so obvious that they’re pointless as well as for being laughably wrong. I suspect they’re also the posts that have had the largest aggregate impact on people – I’ve had a double digit number of people tell me one of the compensation posts changed their life and they now make $x00,000/yr more than they used to because they know it’s possible to get a much higher paying job and I doubt that I even hear from 10% of the people who make a big change as a result of learning that it’s possible to make a lot more money.</p>
<p>When I wrote my first post on compensation, in 2015, I got ridiculed more for writing something obviously wrong than for writing something obvious, but the last few years things have flipped around. I still get the occasional bit of ridicule for being wrong when some corner of Twitter or a web forum that’s well outside the HN/reddit bubble runs across my post, but the ratio of “obviously wrong” to “obvious” has probably gone from 20:1 to 1:5.</p>
<p>Opinions on monorepos have also seen a similar change since 2015. Outside of some folks at big companies, monorepos used to be considered obviously stupid among people who keep up with trends, but this has really changed. Not as much as opinions on compensation, but enough that I’m now a little surprised when I meet a hardline anti-monorepo-er.</p>
<p>Although it’s taken longer for opinions to come around on CPU bugs, that’s probably the post that now gets the least ridicule from the list above.</p>
<p>That markets don’t eliminate all discrimination is the one where opinions have come around the least. Hardline “all markets are efficient” folks aren’t really convinced by academic work like Becker’s The Economics of Discrimination or summaries like the evidence laid out in the post.</p>
<p>The posts on computers having higher latency and the lack of empirical evidence of the benefit of types are the posts I’ve seen pointed to the most often to defend a ridiculable opinion. I didn’t know when I started doing the work for either post and they both happen to have turned up evidence that’s the opposite of the most common loud claims (there’s very good evidence that advanced type systems improve safety in practice and of course computers are faster in every way, people who think they’re slower are just indulging in nostalgia). I don’t know if this has changed many opinion. However, I haven’t gotten much direct ridicule for either post even though both posts directly state a position I see commonly ridiculed online. I suspect that’s partially because both posts are empirical, so there’s not much to dispute (though the post on discrimnation is also empirical, but it still gets its share of ridicule).</p>
<p>The last idea in the list is more meta: no one directly tells me that I should use more obscure terminology. Instead, I get comments that I must not know much about X because I’m not using terms of art. Using terms of art is a common way to establish credibility or authority, but that’s something I don’t really believe in. Arguing from authority doesn’t tell you anything; adding needless terminology just makes things more difficult for readers who aren’t in the field and are reading because they’re interested in the topic but don’t want to actually get into the field.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental disagreement that I have with a lot of people. Just for example, I recently got into a discussion with an authority who insisted that it wasn’t possible for me to reasonably disagree with them (I suggested we agree to disagree) because they’re an authority on the topic and I’m not. It happens that I worked on the formal verification of a system very similar to the system we were discussing, but I didn’t mention that because I don’t believe that my status as an authority on the topic matters. If someone has such a weak argument that they have to fall back on an infallible authority, that’s usually a sign that they don’t have a well-reasoned defense of their position. This goes double when they point to themselves as the infallible authority.</p>
<p>I have about 20 other posts on stupid sounding ideas queued up in my head, but I mostly try to avoid writing things that are controversial, so I don’t know that I’ll write many of those up. If I were to write one post a month (much more frequently than my recent rate) and limit myself to 10% posts on ridiculable ideas, it would take 16 years to write up all of the ridiculable ideas I currently have.</p>

<p>The choice of Overwatch is arbitrary among activities I’m familiar with where:</p>
<p>I know enough about the activity to comment on it<br>I’ve observed enough people trying to learn it that I can say if it’s “easy” or not to fix some mistake or class of mistake<br>There’s a large enough set of rated players is high enough to support the argument<br>Many readers will also be familiar with the activity<br>99% of my gaming background comes from 90s video games, but I’m not going to use those as examples because relatively few readers will be familiar with those games. I could also use “modern” board games like Puerto Rico, Dominion, Terra Mystica, ASL etc., but the set of people who played in rated games is very low, which makes the argument less convincing (perhaps people who play in rated games are much worse than people who don’t – unlikely, but difficult to justify without comparing gameplay between rated and unrated games, which is pretty deep into weeds for this post).</p>
<p>There are numerous activities that would be better to use than Overwatch, but I’m not familiar enough with them to use them as examples. For example, on reading a draft of this post, Kevin Burke noted that he’s observed the same thing while coaching youth basketball and multiple readers noted that they’ve observed the same thing in chess, but I’m not familiar enough with youth basketball or chess to confidently say much about either activity even they’d be better examples because it’s likely that more readers are familiar with basketball or chess than with Overwatch.</p>
<p>When I first started playing Overwatch (which is when I did that experiment), I ended up getting rated slightly above 50%-ile (for Overwatch players, that was in Plat – this post is going to use percentiles and not ranks to avoid making non-Overwatch players have to learn what the ranks mean). It’s generally believed and probably true that people who play the main ranked game mode in Overwatch are, on average, better than people who only play unranked modes, so it’s likely that my actual percentile was somewhat higher than 50%-ile and that all “true” percentiles listed in this post are higher than the nominal percentiles.</p>
<p>Some things you’ll regularly see at slightly above 50%-ile are:</p>
<p>Supports (healers) will heal someone who’s at full health (which does nothing) while a teammate who’s next to them is dying and then dies<br>Players will not notice someone who walks directly behind the team and kills people one at a time until the entire team is killed<br>Players will shoot an enemy until only one more shot is required to kill the enemy and then switch to a different target, letting the 1-health enemy heal back to full health before shooting at that enemy again<br>After dying, players will not wait for their team to respawn and will, instead, run directly into the enemy team to fight them 1v6. This will repeat for the entire game (the game is designed to be 6v6, but in ranks below 95%-ile, it’s rare to see a 6v6 engagement after one person on one team dies)<br>Players will clearly have no idea what character abilities do, including for the character they’re playing<br>Players go for very high risk but low reward plays (for Overwatch players, a classic example of this is Rein going for a meme pin when the game opens on 2CP defense, very common at 50%-ile, rare at 95%-ile since players who think this move is a good idea tend to have generally poor decision making).<br>People will have terrible aim and will miss four or five shots in a row when all they need to do is hit someone once to kill them<br>If a single flanking enemy threatens a healer who can’t escape plus a non-healer with an escape ability, the non-healer will probably use their ability to run away, leaving the healer to die, even though they could easily kill the flanker and save their healer if they just attacked while being healed.<br>Having just one aspect of your gameplay be merely bad instead of atrocious is enough to get to 50%-ile. For me, that was my teamwork, for others, it’s other parts of their gameplay. The reason I’d say that my teamwork was bad and not good or even mediocre was that I basically didn’t know how to play the game, didn’t know what any of the characters’ strengths, weaknesses, and abilities are, so I couldn’t possibly coordinate effectively with my team. I also didn’t know how the game modes actually worked (e.g., under what circumstances the game will end in a tie vs. going into another round), so I was basically wandering around randomly with a preference towards staying near the largest group of teammates I could find. That’s above average.</p>
<p>You could say that someone is pretty good at the game since they’re above average. But in a non-relative sense, being slightly above average is quite bad – it’s hard to argue that someone who doesn’t notice their entire team being killed from behind while two teammates are yelling “[enemy] behind us!” over voice comms isn’t bad.</p>
<p>After playing a bit more, I ended up with what looks like a “true” rank of about 90%-ile when I’m using a character I know how to use. Due to volatility in ranking as well as matchmaking, I played in games as high as 98%-ile. My aim and dodging were still atrocious. Relative to my rank, my aim was actually worse than when I was playing in 50%-ile games since my opponents were much better and I was only a little bit better. In 90%-ile, two copies of myself would probably lose fighting against most people 2v1 in the open. I would also usually lose a fight if the opponent was in the open and I was behind cover such that only 10% of my character was exposed, so my aim was arguably more than 10x worse than median at my rank.</p>
<p>My “trick” for getting to 90%-ile despite being a 1/10th aimer was learning how the game worked and playing in a way that maximized the probability of winning (to the best of my ability), as opposed to playing the game like it’s an FFA game where your goal is to get kills as quickly as possible. It takes a bit more context to describe what this means in 90%-ile, so I’ll only provide a couple examples, but these are representative of mistakes the vast majority of 90%-ile players are making all of the time (with the exception of a few players who have grossly defective aim, like myself, who make up for their poor aim by playing better than average for the rank in other ways).</p>
<p>Within the game, the goal of the game is to win. There are different game modes, but for the mainline ranked game, they all will involve some kind of objective that you have to be on or near. It’s very common to get into a situation where the round timer is ticking down to zero and your team is guaranteed to lose if no one on your team touches the objective but your team may win if someone can touch the objective and not die instantly (which will cause the game to go into overtime until shortly after both teams stop touching the objective). A concrete example of this that happens somewhat regularly is, the enemy team has four players on the objective while your team has two players near the objective, one tank and one support/healer. The other four players on your team died and are coming back from spawn. They’re close enough that if you can touch the objective and not instantly die, they’ll arrive and probably take the objective for the win, but they won’t get there in time if you die immediately after taking the objective, in which case you’ll lose.</p>
<p>If you’re playing the support/healer at 90%-ile to 95%-ile, this game will almost always end as follows: the tank will move towards the objective, get shot, decide they don’t want to take damage, and then back off from the objective. As a support, you have a small health pool and will die instantly if you touch the objective because the other team will shoot you. Since your team is guaranteed to lose if you don’t move up to the objective, you’re forced to do so to have any chance of winning. After you’re killed, the tank will either move onto the objective and die or walk towards the objective but not get there before time runs out. Either way, you’ll probably lose.</p>
<p>If the tank did their job and moved onto the objective before you died, you could heal the tank for long enough that the rest of your team will arrive and you’ll probably win. The enemy team, if they were coordinated, could walk around or through the tank to kill you, but they won’t do that – anyone who knows that will cause them to win the game and can aim well enough to successfully follow through can’t help but end up in a higher rank). And the hypothetical tank on your team who knows that it’s their job to absorb damage for their support in that situation and not vice versa won’t stay at 95%-ile very long because they’ll win too many games and move up to a higher rank.</p>
<p>Another basic situation that the vast majority of 90%-ile to 95%-ile players will get wrong is when you’re on offense, waiting for your team to respawn so you can attack as a group. Even at 90%-ile, maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of players won’t do this and will just run directly at the enemy team, but enough players will realize that 1v6 isn’t a good idea that you’ll often 5v6 or 6v6 fights instead of the constant 1v6 and 2v6 fights you see at 50%-ile. Anyway, while waiting for the team to respawn in order to get a 5v6, it’s very likely one player who realizes that they shouldn’t just run into the middle of the enemy team 1v6 will decide they should try to hit the enemy team with long-ranged attacks 1v6. People will do this instead of hiding in safety behind a wall even when the enemy has multiple snipers with instant-kill long range attacks. People will even do this against multiple snipers when they’re playing a character that isn’t a sniper and needs to hit the enemy 2-3 times to get a kill, making it overwhelmingly likely that they won’t get a kill while taking a significant risk of dying themselves. For Overwatch players, people will also do this when they have full ult charge and the other team doesn’t, turning a situation that should be to your advantage (your team has ults ready and the other team has used ults), into a neutral situation (both teams have ults) at best, and instantly losing the fight at worst.</p>
<p>If you ever read an Overwatch forum, whether that’s one of the reddit forums or the official Blizzard forums, a common complaint is “why are my teammates so bad? I’m at [90%-ile to 95%-ile rank], but all my teammates are doing obviously stupid game-losing things all the time, like [an example above]”. The answer is, of course, that the person asking the question is also doing obviously stupid game-losing things all the time because anyone who doesn’t constantly make makor blunders wins too much to stay at 95%-ile. This also applies to me.</p>
<p>People will argue that players at this rank should be good because they’re better than 95% of other players, which makes them relatively good. But non-relatively, it’s hard to argue that someone who doesn’t realize that you should step on the objective to probably win the game instead of not touching the objective for a sure loss is good. One of the most basic things about Overwatch is that it’s an objective-based game, but the majority of players at 90%-ile to 95%-ile don’t play that way.</p>
<p>For anyone who isn’t well into the 99%-ile, reviewing recorded games will reveal game-losing mistakes all the time. For myself, usually ranked 90%-ile or so, watching a recorded game will reveal tens of game losing mistakes in a close game (which is maybe 30% of losses, the other 70% are blowouts where there isn’t a single simple mistake that decides the game).</p>
<p>It’s generally not too hard to fix these since the mistakes are like the example above: simple enough that once you see that you’re making the mistake, the fix is straightforward because the mistake is straightforward.</p>
<p>There are probably some people who just want to be angry at their teammates. Due to how infrequently you get matched with the same players, it’s hard to see this in the main rated game mode, but I think you can sometimes see this when Overwatch sometimes runs mini-rated modes.</p>
<p>Mini-rated modes have a much smaller playerbase than the main rated mode, which has two notable side effects: players with a much wider variety of skill levels will be thrown into the same game and you’ll see the same players over and over again if you play multiple games.</p>
<p>Since you ended up matched with the same players repeatedly, you’ll see players make the same mistakes and cause themselves to lose in the same way and then have the same tantrum and blame their teammates in the same way game after game.</p>
<p>You’ll also see tantrums and teammate blaming in the normal rated game mode, but when you see it, you generally can’t tell if the person who’s having a tantrum is just having a bad day or if it’s some other one-off occurrence since, unless you’re ranked very high or very low (where there’s a smaller pool of closely rated players), you don’t run into the same players all that frequently. But when you see a set of players in 15-20 games over the course of a few weeks and you see them lose the game for the same reason a double digit number of times followed by the exact same tantrum, you might start to suspect that some fraction of those people really want to be angry and that the main thing they’re getting out of playing the game is a source of anger. You might also wonder about this from how some people use social media, but that’s a topic for another post.</p>
<p>For example, there will also be players who have some kind of disability that prevents them from improving, but at the levels we’re talking about, 99%-ile or below, that will be relatively rare (certainly well under 50%, and I think it’s not unreasonable to guess that it’s well under 10% of people who choose to play the game). IIRC, there’s at least one player who’s in the top 500 who’s deaf (this is severely disadvantageous since sound cues give a lot of fine-grained positional information that cannot be obtained in any other way), at least one legally blind player who’s 99%-ile, and multiple players with physical impairments that prevent them from having fine-grained control of a mouse, i.e., who are basically incapable of aiming, who are 99%-ile.</p>
<p>There are also other kinds of reasons people might not improve. For example, Kevin Burke has noted that when he coaches youth basketball, some children don’t want to do drills that they think make them look foolish (e.g., avoiding learning to dribble with their off hand even during drills where everyone is dribbling poorly because they’re using their off hand). When I spent a lot of time in a climbing gym with a world class coach who would regularly send a bunch of kids to nationals and some to worlds, I’d observe the same thing in his classes – kids, even ones who are nationally or internationally competitive, would sometimes avoid doing things because they were afraid it would make them look foolish to their peers. The coach’s solution in those cases was to deliberately make the kid look extremely foolish and tell them that it’s better to look stupid now than at nationals.</p>
<p>note that, here, a skilled coach is someone who is skilled at coaching, not necessarily someone who is skilled at the activity. People who are skilled at the activity but who haven’t explicitly been taught how to teach or spent a lot of time working on teaching are generally poor coaches.<br>If you read the acknowledgements section of any of my posts, you can see that I get feedback from more than just two people on most posts (and I really appreciate the feedback), but I think that, by volume, well over 90% of the feedback I’ve gotten has come from Leah and a professional editor. </p>

<p>The code for this project is located <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dabit3/full-stack-ethereum">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently joined <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/edgeandnode">Edge &amp; Node</a> as a Developer Relations Engineer and have been diving deeper into smart contract development with Ethereum. I have settled upon what I think is the best stack for building full stack dApps with Solidity:</p>
<p>▶︎ Client Framework - <strong>React</strong><br>▶︎ Ethereum development environment - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hardhat.org/"><strong>Hardhat</strong></a><br>▶︎ Ethereum Web Client Library - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/"><strong>Ethers.js</strong></a><br>▶︎ API layer - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thegraph.com/">The Graph Protocol</a></p>
<p>The problem that I ran into though while learning this was that while there was fairly good documentation out there for each of these things individually, there was nothing really out there for how to put all of these things together and understand how they worked with each other. There are some really good boilerplates out there like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth">scaffold-eth</a> (which also includes Ethers, Hardhat, and The Graph), but may be too much to pick up for people just getting started.</p>
<p>I wanted an end to end guide to show me how to build full stack Ethereum apps using the most up to date resources, libraries, and tooling.</p>
<p>The things I was interested in were this:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to create, deploy, and test Ethereum smart contracts to local, test, and mainnet</li>
<li>How to switch between local, test, and production environments / networks</li>
<li>How to connect to and interact with the contracts using various environments from a front end like React, Vue, Svelte, or Angular</li>
</ol>
<p>After spending some time figuring all of this out and getting going with the stack that I felt really happy with, I thought it would be nice to write up how to build and test a full stack Ethereum app using this stack not only for other people out there who may be interested in this stack, but also for myself for future reference. This is that reference.</p>
<h2 id="The-pieces"><a href="#The-pieces" class="headerlink" title="The pieces"></a>The pieces</h2><p>Let’s go over the main pieces we will be using and how they fit into the stack.</p>
<h3 id="1-Ethereum-development-environment"><a href="#1-Ethereum-development-environment" class="headerlink" title="1. Ethereum development environment"></a>1. Ethereum development environment</h3><p>When building smart contracts, you will need a way to deploy your contracts, run tests, and debug Solidity code without dealing with live environments.</p>
<p>You will also need a way to compile your Solidity code into code that can be run in a client-side application – in our case, a React app. We’ll learn more about how this works a little later.</p>
<p>Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development and is the framework that I will be using for this tutorial.</p>
<p>Other similar tools in the ecosystem are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/">Truffle</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-Ethereum-Web-Client-Library"><a href="#2-Ethereum-Web-Client-Library" class="headerlink" title="2. Ethereum Web Client Library"></a>2. Ethereum Web Client Library</h3><p>In our React app, we will need a way to interact with the smart contracts that have been deployed. We will need a way to read for data as well as send new transactions. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/">ethers.js</a> aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem from client-side JavaScript applications like React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte. It is the library we’ll be using.</p>
<p>Another popular option in the ecosystem is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/">web3.js</a></p>
<h3 id="3-Metamask"><a href="#3-Metamask" class="headerlink" title="3. Metamask"></a>3. Metamask</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://metamask.io/download.html">Metamask</a> helps to handle account management and connecting the current user to the blockchain. MetaMask enables users to manage their accounts and keys in a few different ways while isolating them from the site context.</p>
<p>Once a user has connected their MetaMask wallet, you as a developer can interact with the globally available Ethereum API (<code>window.ethereum</code>) that identifies the users of web3-compatible browsers (like MetaMask users), and whenever you request a transaction signature, MetaMask will prompt the user in as comprehensible a way as possible.</p>
<h3 id="4-React"><a href="#4-React" class="headerlink" title="4. React"></a>4. React</h3><p>React is a front end JavaScript library for building web applications, user interfaces, and UI components. It’s maintained by Facebook and many many individual developers and companies.</p>
<p>React and its large ecosystem of metaframeworks like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://redwoodjs.com/">Redwood</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>, and others enable all types of deployment targets including traditional SPAs, static site generators, server-side rendering, and a combination of all three. React continues to be seemingly dominating the front-end space and I think will continue to do so for at least the near future.</p>
<h3 id="5-The-Graph"><a href="#5-The-Graph" class="headerlink" title="5. The Graph"></a>5. The Graph</h3><p>For most apps built on blockchains like Ethereum, it’s hard and time-intensive to read data directly from the chain, so you used to see people and companies building their own centralized indexing server and serving API requests from these servers. This requires a lot of engineering and hardware resources and breaks the security properties required for decentralization.</p>
<p>The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying blockchain data that enables the creation of fully decentralized applications and solves this problem, exposing a rich GraphQL query layer that apps can consume. In this guide we won’t be building a subgraph for our app but will do so in a future tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="What-we-will-be-building"><a href="#What-we-will-be-building" class="headerlink" title="What we will be building"></a>What we will be building</h2><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be building, deploying, and connecting to a couple of basic smart contracts: </p>
<ol>
<li>A contract for creating and updating a message on the Ethereum blockchain</li>
<li>A contract for minting tokens, then allowing the owner of the contract to send tokens to others and to read the token balances, and for owners of the new tokens to also send them to others.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will also build out a React front end that will allow a user to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the greeting from the contract deployed to the blockchain</li>
<li>Update the greeting</li>
<li>Send the newly minted tokens from their address to another address</li>
<li>Once someone has received tokens, allow them to also send their tokens to someone else</li>
<li>Read the token balance from the contract deployed to the blockchain</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h3><ol>
<li>Node.js installed on your local machine</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> Chrome extension installed in your browser</li>

<p>You do not need to own any Ethereum for this guide as we will be using fake / test Ether on a test network for the entire tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-started"><a href="#Getting-started" class="headerlink" title="Getting started"></a>Getting started</h2><p>To get started, we’ll create a new React application:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npx create-react-app react-dapp</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>Next, change into the new directory and install <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/"><code>ethers.js</code></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat"><code>hardhat</code></a> using either <strong>NPM</strong> or <strong>Yarn</strong>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs&#x2F;hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs&#x2F;hardhat-ethers</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<h3 id="Installing-amp-configuring-an-Ethereum-development-environment"><a href="#Installing-amp-configuring-an-Ethereum-development-environment" class="headerlink" title="Installing &amp; configuring an Ethereum development environment"></a>Installing &amp; configuring an Ethereum development environment</h3><p>Next, initialize a new Ethereum Development Environment with Hardhat:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npx hardhat</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">? What do you want to do? Create a sample project</span><br><span class="line">? Hardhat project root: &lt;Choose default path&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>Now you should see the following artifacts created for you in your root directory:</p>
<p><strong>hardhat.config.js</strong> - The entirety of your Hardhat setup (i.e. your config, plugins, and custom tasks) is contained in this file.<br><strong>scripts</strong> - A folder containing a script named <strong>sample-script.js</strong> that will deploy your smart contract when executed<br><strong>test</strong> - A folder containing an example testing script<br><strong>contracts</strong> - A folder holding an example Ethereum smart contract</p>
<p>Because of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hardhat.org/metamask-issue.html">a MetaMask configuration issue</a>, we need to update the chain ID on our HardHat configuration to be <strong>1337</strong>. We also need to update the location for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hardhat.org/guides/compile-contracts.html#artifacts">artifacts</a> for our compiled contracts to be in the <strong>src</strong> directory of our React app.</p>
<p>To make these updates, open <strong>hardhat.config.js</strong> and update the <code>module.exports</code>to look like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">module.exports &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  solidity: &quot;0.8.3&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  paths: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    artifacts: &#39;.&#x2F;src&#x2F;artifacts&#39;,</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">  networks: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    hardhat: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      chainId: 1337</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This is a very basic smart contract. When deployed, it sets a Greeting variable and exposes a function (<code>greet</code>) that can be called to return the greeting.</p>
<p>It also exposes a function that allows a user to update the greeting (<code>setGreeting</code>). When deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, these methods will be available for a user to interact with.</p>
<p>Let’s make one small modification to the smart contract. Since we set the solidity version of our compiler to <code>0.8.3</code> in <strong>hardhat.config.js</strong>, let’s also be sure to update our contract to use the same version of solidity:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F; contracts&#x2F;Greeter.sol</span><br><span class="line">pragma solidity ^0.8.3;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<h3 id="Reading-and-writing-to-the-Ethereum-blockchain"><a href="#Reading-and-writing-to-the-Ethereum-blockchain" class="headerlink" title="Reading and writing to the Ethereum blockchain"></a>Reading and writing to the Ethereum blockchain</h3><p>There are two types of ways to interact with a smart contract, reading or writing / transactions. In our contract, <code>greet</code> can be considered reading, and <code>setGreeting</code>can be considered writing / transactional.</p>
<p>When writing or initializing a transaction, you have to pay for the transaction to be written to the blockchain. To make this work, you need to pay [gas](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp#:~:text=What">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp#:~:text=What</a> Is Gas (Ethereum)%3F,on the Ethereum blockchain platform) which is the fee, or price, required to successfully conduct a transaction and execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As long as you are only reading from the blockchain and not changing or updating anything, you don’t need to carry out a transaction and there will be no gas or cost to do so. The function you call is then carried out only by the node you are connected to, so you don’t need to pay any gas and the read is free.</p>
<p>From our React app, the way that we will interact with the smart contract is using a combination of the <code>ethers.js</code> library, the contract address, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html">ABI</a> that will be created from the contract by hardhat.</p>
<p>What is an ABI? ABI stands for application binary interface. You can think of it as the interface between your client-side application and the Ethereum blockchain where the smart contract you are going to be interacting with is deployed.</p>
<p>ABIs are typically compiled from Solidity smart contracts by a development framework like HardHat. You can also often find the ABIs for a smart contract on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a></p>
<h3 id="Compiling-the-ABI"><a href="#Compiling-the-ABI" class="headerlink" title="Compiling the ABI"></a>Compiling the ABI</h3><p>Now that we have gone over the basic smart contract and know what ABIs are, let’s compile an ABI for our project.</p>
<p>To do so, go to the command line and run the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npx hardhat compile</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>Now, you should see a new folder named <strong>artifacts</strong> in the <strong>src</strong> directory. The <strong>artifacts/contracts/Greeter.json</strong> file contains the ABI as one of the properties. When we need to use the ABI, we can import it from our JavaScript file:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">import Greeter from &#39;.&#x2F;artifacts&#x2F;contracts&#x2F;Greeter.sol&#x2F;Greeter.json&#39;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>We can then reference the ABI like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">console.log(&quot;Greeter ABI: &quot;, Greeter.abi)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>Note that Ethers.js also enables <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ricmoo.com/human-readable-contract-abis-in-ethers-js-141902f4d917">human readable ABIs</a>, but will will not be going into this during this tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="Deploying-and-using-a-local-network-blockchain"><a href="#Deploying-and-using-a-local-network-blockchain" class="headerlink" title="Deploying and using a local network / blockchain"></a>Deploying and using a local network / blockchain</h3><p>Next, let’s deploy our smart contract to a local blockchain so that we can test it out.</p>
<p>To deploy to the local network, you first need to start the local test node. To do so, open the CLI and run the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npx hardhat node</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>When we run this command, you should see a list of addresses and private keys. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A_zc2Dpd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e176nc82ik77hei3a48s.jpg"><img src="../images/e176nc82ik77hei3a48s.jpg" alt="Hardhat node addresses"></a></p>
<p>These are 20 test accounts and addresses created for us that we can use to deploy and test our smart contracts. Each account is also loaded up with 10,000 fake Ether. In a moment, we’ll learn how to import the test account into MetaMask so that we can use it.</p>
<p>Next, we need to deploy the contract to the test network. First update the name of <strong>scripts/sample-script.js</strong> to <strong>scripts/deploy.js</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we can run the deploy script and give a flag to the CLI that we would like to deploy to our local network:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npx hardhat run scripts&#x2F;deploy.js --network localhost</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>Once this script is executed, the smart contract should be deployed to the local test network and we should be then able to start interacting with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the contract was deployed, it used the first account that was created when we started the local network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the output from the CLI, you should be able to see something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Greeter deployed to: 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>This address is what we will use in our client application to talk to the smart contract. Keep this address available as we will need to use it when connecting to it from the client application.</p>
<p>To send transactions to the smart contract, we will need to connect our MetaMask wallet using one of the accounts created when we ran <code>npx hardhat node</code>. In the list of contracts that the CLI logs out, you should see both an <strong>Account number</strong> as well as a <strong>Private Key</strong>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">➜  react-defi-stack git:(main) npx hardhat node</span><br><span class="line">Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;127.0.0.1:8545&#x2F;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Accounts</span><br><span class="line">&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;</span><br><span class="line">Account #0: 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 (10000 ETH)</span><br><span class="line">Private Key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>We can import this account into MetaMask in order to start using some of the fake Eth available there. To do so, first open MetaMask and update the network to be Localhost 8545:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UIsqf9Wh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qnbsbcm4y1md6cwjttpx.jpg"><img src="../images/qnbsbcm4y1md6cwjttpx.jpg" alt="MetaMask Localhost"></a></p>
<p>Next, in MetaMask click on <strong>Import Account</strong> from the accounts menu:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rUGcfvYR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n7vbzlov869gwk9rtwl1.jpg"><img src="../images/n7vbzlov869gwk9rtwl1.jpg" alt="Import account"></a></p>
<p>Copy then paste one of the <strong>Private Keys</strong> logged out by the CLI and click <strong>Import</strong>. Once the account is imported, you should see the Eth in the account:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---AfAcDFH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x5lob4yug3jznhy9z0qt.jpg"><img src="../images/x5lob4yug3jznhy9z0qt.jpg" alt="Imported account"></a></p>
<p>Now that we have a smart contract deployed and an account ready to use, we can start interacting with it from the React app.</p>
<h3 id="Connecting-the-React-client"><a href="#Connecting-the-React-client" class="headerlink" title="Connecting the React client"></a>Connecting the React client</h3><p>In this tutorial we are not going to be worrying about building a beautiful UI with CSS and all of that, we are focused 100% on the core functionality to get you up and running. From there, you can take it and make it look good if you’d like.</p>
<p>With that being said, let’s review the two objectives that we want from our React application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch the current value of <code>greeting</code> from the smart contract</li>
<li>Allow a user to update the value of the <code>greeting</code></li>
</ol>
<p>With those things being understood, how do we accomplish this? Here are the things we need to do to make this happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an input field and some local state to manage the value of the input (to update the <code>greeting</code>)</li>
<li>Allow the application to connect to the user’s MetaMask account to sign transactions</li>
<li>Create functions for reading and writing to the smart contract</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this, open <code>src/App.js</code> and update it with the following code, setting the value of <code>greeterAddress</code> to the address of your smart contract.:</p>

<p>When the app loads, you should be able to fetch the current greeting and log it out to the console. You should also be able to make updates to the greeting by signing the contract with your MetaMask wallet and spending the fake Ether.</p>

<h3 id="Deploying-and-using-a-live-test-network"><a href="#Deploying-and-using-a-live-test-network" class="headerlink" title="Deploying and using a live test network"></a>Deploying and using a live test network</h3><p>There are several Ethereum test networks like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or Kovan that we can also deploy to in order to have a publicly accessible version of our contract available without having to deploy it to mainnet. In this tutorial we’ll be deploying to the <strong>Ropsten</strong> test network.</p>
<p>To start off, first update your MetaMask wallet to connect to the Ropsten network.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HSvy3DUN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k85gplgp26wp58l95bhr.jpg"><img src="../images/k85gplgp26wp58l95bhr.jpg" alt="Ropsten network"></a></p>
<p>Next, send yourself some test Ether to use during the rest of this tutorial by visiting <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://faucet.ropsten.be/">this test faucet</a>.</p>
<p>We can get access to Ropsten (or any of the other test networks) by signing up with a service like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum/cbdf7c5eee8b4e2b91e76b77ffd34533/settings">Infura</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.alchemyapi.io/">Alchemy</a> (I’m using Infura for this tutorial).</p>
<p>Once you’ve created the app in Infura or Alchemy, you will be given an endpoint that looks something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ropsten.infura.io&#x2F;v3&#x2F;your-project-id</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>Be sure to set the <strong>ALLOWLIST ETHEREUM ADDRESSES</strong> in the Infura or Alchemy app configuration to include the wallet address of the account you will be deploying from.</p>
<p>To deploy to the test network we need to update our hardhat config with some additional network information. One of the things we need to set is the private key of the wallet we will be deploying from.</p>
<p>To get the private key, you can export it from MetaMask.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_g7R_Fdh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/deod3d6qix8us12t17i4.jpg"><img src="../images/deod3d6qix8us12t17i4.jpg" alt="Export private key"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d suggest not hardcoding this value in your app but instead setting it as something like an environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, add a <code>networks</code> property with the following configuration:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">module.exports &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  defaultNetwork: &quot;hardhat&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  paths: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    artifacts: &#39;.&#x2F;src&#x2F;artifacts&#39;,</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">  networks: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    hardhat: &#123;&#125;,</span><br><span class="line">    ropsten: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      url: &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ropsten.infura.io&#x2F;v3&#x2F;your-project-id&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">      accounts: [&#96;0x$&#123;your-private-key&#125;&#96;]</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">  solidity: &quot;0.7.3&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>To deploy, run the following script:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npx hardhat run scripts&#x2F;deploy.js --network ropsten</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>Once your contract is deployed you should be able to start interacting with it. You should be now able to view the live contract on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">Etherscan Ropsten Testnet Explorer</a></p>
<h2 id="Minting-tokens"><a href="#Minting-tokens" class="headerlink" title="Minting tokens"></a>Minting tokens</h2><p>One of the most common use cases of smart contracts is creating tokens, let’s look at how we can do that. Since we know a little more about how all of this works, we’ll be going a little faster.</p>
<p>In the main <strong>contracts</strong> directory create a new file named <strong>Token.sol</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, update <strong>Token.sol</strong> with the following smart contract:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This contract will create a new token called “Nader Dabit Token” and set the supply to 1000000.</p>
<p>Next, compile this contract:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npx hardhat compile</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>Now, update the deploy script at <strong>scripts/deploy.js</strong> to include this new Token contract:</p>

<p>Now, we can deploy this new contract to the local or Ropsten network:</p>

<p>Once the contract is deployed, you can start sending these tokens to other addresses.</p>
<p>To do so, let’s update the client code we will need in order to make this work:</p>

<p>Next, let’s try to send those coins to another address.</p>
<p>To do so, copy the address of another account and send them to that address using the updated React UI. When you check the token amount, it should be equal to the original amount minus the amount you sent to the address.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Ok, we covered a lot here but for me this is kind of the bread and butter / core of getting started with this stack and is kind of what I wanted to have not only as someone who was learning all of this stuff, but also in the future if I ever need to reference anything I may need in the future. I hope you learned a lot.</p>
<p>If you want to support multiple wallets in addition to MetaMask, check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal">Web3 Modal</a> which makes it easy to implement support for multiple providers in your app with a fairly simple and customizable configuration.</p>
<p>In my future tutorials and guides I’ll be diving into more complex smart contract development and also how to deploy them as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thegraph.com/docs/define-a-subgraph">subgraphs</a> to expose a GraphQL API on top of them and implement things like pagination and full text search.</p>
<p>I’ll also be going into how to use technologies like IPFS and Web3 databases to store data in a decentralized way.</p>

  <ol>
<li>Always Keep learning<br>Telling yourself that you don’t know something is the first step towards learning something new. Often experienced programmers find it hard to identify areas where they lack because they believe that they know everything. Learn from everyone and everything that comes your way as it will help you become a better coder.</li>
<li>Improve with experience<br>To be great at something you must learn from your mistakes. We become better at a task with experience. However, it is true only when we learn from our experience and try to improve on ourselves. Staying with the same mindset and beliefs won’t make you any better. As a programmer always strive to do better than before as it will help you gain experience in a real sense.</li>
<li>Seek for perfection<br>Often we stop once we think that we have achieved the goal. Programmers often focus only on writing quality codes and most of them stop when they feel it is done. However, to be a better programmer you must understand that codes are never perfect, work is required to make them perfect. Always strive to look for perfection, it might mean making the product faster, reliable, feature-packed but there is always room for improvement.</li>
<li>Write it thrice<br>Good programmers usually write codes many times till they are satisfied that they have achieved their goals to some extent. It is advised that you work on your codes thrice at least. The first time you write you make yourself believe that the idea can be out to practice. The second time when you work on it you actually strive to bring out all that is expected from the solution. The third time should be focused on making it perfect. There are always many approaches to the problem but there is always the best solution. Work till you find the perfect way out.</li>
<li>Read codes<br>Just like reading is important to expand your wisdom. In coding, reading what other programmers have written is quite important. Codes can be written in many ways, and there is of course no one right way. When you read others code you learn about other possibilities that you may otherwise be not aware of. It is also a great way to brush up and improve your programming skills. Interact with other coders whenever possible, participate in coding forums and learn from these experiences.</li>

  <p>I think this is a great question if you take it seriously, because when you think about it critically, it exposes all of the things JavaScript don’t really <strong>need</strong> to know. Can you contribute productively as a mid-level JavaScript developer without knowing anything about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>? Sure! Can you contribute productively if you’re writing and testing your JavaScript using *&lt;awful uncool code editor that you the reader can’t stand&gt;*? Definitely. So here’s my take on answering the question.</p>
<h2 id="Assumptions"><a href="#Assumptions" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a>Assumptions</h2><p>I’m making the following assumptions about the question</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I’m assuming the audience is a developer who has some level of professional programming experience and some existing JavaScript experience, and that they are primarily interested in “code skill” answers. Thus I’ll exclude things like communication ability, experience with version control, professional conduct, or basic coding ability that are very important to success in a JavaScript development environment but are out of the scope of this question.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I’m optimizing for “what specific pre-existing knowledge will make the most difference between success and failure for a new hire in a mid-level JavaScript role”.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-existing</strong> means that these are things that somebody is expected to know before taking the job. Learning the details of a company’s technology stack, style guide and engineering philosophy are all important, but you shouldn’t be expected to know them in advance, and in many cases doing so is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Specific knowledge</strong> means that these are things that you can learn with some effort and study. They should not be broad categories like “security”, “design”, or “server-side development”. They should be things you know or know how to do, not things you “have experience with”. And they should be specific enough that somebody can feel comfortable saying they understand the topic or don’t. Most of the things I list below are <em>topics</em>, but I try to lay out a specific set of things that you would need to know to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>The most difference between success and failure</strong> means that these are the things that are really going to make a difference in how effective you are at understanding and completing the work assigned to you. There are many such things, and their importance will vary situationally, so this is just my educated take on a generalists list.</p>
<p>When I say <strong>mid-level</strong>, I’m picturing hiring for a role that pays well but is not the most senior person on the team. This would be a developer who would be expected to complete tasks with minimal help and oversight but wouldn’t necessarily be planning the architecture of everything right off the bat. To be clear this list is not a set of things that you need to go to get paid to write JavaScript. It is more along the lines of “next steps” for junior devs. Its also not a step function where you need to know all of these at once to get to the next level. These are just things that may limit you if you don’t have them.</p>
<p>I’m taking the liberty to assume that <strong>JavaScript role</strong> implies using JavaScript in some sort of client/UI environment (Browser, React Native, Cordova, Electron, etc). This list would be at least a bit different for a Node.js server-side role, and somebody else will have to write that post.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="The-List"><a href="#The-List" class="headerlink" title="The List"></a>The List</h2><h4 id="1-You-should-know-the-core-language"><a href="#1-You-should-know-the-core-language" class="headerlink" title="1. You should know the core language"></a>1. You should know the core language</h4><p>JavaScript is not a very complicated language at its core. It can seem difficult to learn because of all of the noise around it. Browser APIs, Library APIs, jQuery, React, TypeScript, the many npm packages out there, etc all can make the language syntax space seem huge. And this isn’t helped by the fact that the language has evolved over time so you’ll see many different ways to do a single task spread out over the internet. But the core language and standard libraries are actually pretty small compared to languages like Python and Java that have more features and larger standard libraries. Eventually you’ll need the ecosystem. But knowing the core language features that are implemented in most browsers is a great start.</p>
<p>This means you should know about basic language features like if/else, error handling with throw/try/catch, array manipulation with push/map/reduce/filter, and string manipulation methods like replace/slice/split. You should also know about how JavaScript handles things like truthiness and falsiness<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-1">1</a>, how to work with JSON data with the JSON object methods, and how variable scope works in JavaScript. These days its also becoming more and more important to have at least a basic familiarity with the more important language features that were added in ES6 like Promises, modules, classes, template literals, generators and destructuring. Even if you choose not to use those features, being able to see and understand them will help you learn faster from others.</p>
<p>This list is mostly unordered, but this comes first because learning everything else becomes a lot harder without this knowledge, mostly because it becomes difficult to learn from other people’s code since you won’t understand what it is doing. If you’re starting from a weak base here I’d recommend finding a good book on the core language like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2uD4R1Y">Eloquent JavaScript</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-2">2</a> and digging in. If you’ve been using JavaScript in an older code base or haven’t used it in a while and want to catch up, you can see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/">my post on keeping up with new language features</a>.</p>
<h4 id="2-You-should-understand-async-code"><a href="#2-You-should-understand-async-code" class="headerlink" title="2. You should understand async code"></a>2. You should understand async code</h4><p>One of the biggest leaps for new JavaScript developers, even those who are experienced with other languages is the amount of asynchronous code found in idiomatic JavaScript. Asynchronous (async) code is code that is scheduled to run at a later time after some event, delay or response. It can appear a bunch of different ways in JavaScript code, and it’s important to be able to interpret them.</p>
<p>This means learning about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2015/12/30/es6-patterns-converting-callbacks-to-promises/">callbacks and promises</a> at least. You should also learn about the JavaScript <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/10/27/the-javascript-event-loop-explained/">event loop</a> and how it works Ideally some of the standard APIs that use them like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Talk:DOM/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch">fetch</a>. If you’re ambitious you can learn about newer async syntax and library implementations like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await">async-await</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">RxJS</a> But the most important thing is to spend time using and writing async code so that you get an intuitive understanding of how it works.</p>
<h4 id="3-You-should-get-comfortable-with-at-least-one-set-of-developer-tools"><a href="#3-You-should-get-comfortable-with-at-least-one-set-of-developer-tools" class="headerlink" title="3. You should get comfortable with at least one set of developer tools"></a>3. You should get comfortable with at least one set of developer tools</h4><p>When developing JavaScript, its important to be able to debug problems and understand how existing systems work. JavaScript has a fantastic ecosystem of developer tools for diagnosing bugs and examining application code. For the most part they’re bundled with browsers (though some IDEs like VS Code and WebStorm have their own debuggers). Learning how to use these tools well will turbocharge your JS dev skills. If you can’t use them though, it will make everything much harder.</p>
<p>Competence in this means comfort with at least the JavaScript debugger panel of a browser’s devtools. You should be able to set and use breakpoints, use watch mode and the console to test for the value of expressions, and understand the stack traces. But its also good to get comfortable using the elements panel to understand and manipulate the DOM, and the network panel to debug network requests.</p>
<h4 id="4-You-should-be-proficient-with-JavaScript-functions"><a href="#4-You-should-be-proficient-with-JavaScript-functions" class="headerlink" title="4. You should be proficient with JavaScript functions"></a>4. You should be proficient with JavaScript functions</h4><p>Functions are the core of the JavaScript language. You should be able to use them fluently. That means understanding function scope, closures, how <code>this</code> works, and the difference between normal functions and arrow functions. It also means knowing about how to process arrays with function using methods like map, filter, and reduce. A good resource for “thinking in functions” is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read">JavaScript Allonge</a> by Reginald Braithwaite.</p>
<h4 id="5-You-should-be-comfortable-with-basic-design-tasks"><a href="#5-You-should-be-comfortable-with-basic-design-tasks" class="headerlink" title="5. You should be comfortable with basic design tasks"></a>5. You should be comfortable with basic design tasks</h4><p>No matter how well you learn JavaScript, you’ll be limited career-wise if you can’t manage basic design tasks. This might not seem inherently true; after all isn’t that what professional designers are for? But the truth is that unless you’re a purely server-side developer (excluded by our assumptions above), there will be times when you’re asked to fill in a visual gap that a designer doesn’t have time for, or there will be ambiguities in a designers spec that aren’t worth a meeting. And learning the basics of design will help you communicate better with designers and product managers about technical constraints and design requirements.</p>
<p>When I talk design, I mean both the basics of implementing a visual design with HTML and CSS<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-3">3</a>, and enough of an understanding of design basics to create a simple UI that looks ok and isn’t confusing. That last requirement is harder than you’d think. Design is hard and mostly orthogonal to the set of skills most folks pick up while learning to code. For learning design theory, I’d recommend finding a simple resource on visual design first like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2uz3vEG">White Space is Not Your Enemy</a>, and ideally supplementing that with a more UX focused resource like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2uvUrR7">Don’t Make Me Think</a>. The practical side of HTML/CSS is easiest to pick up with experience. If you’re using devtools you can see what other people are doing with CSS and tweak and explore using the elements panel. And there are lots of good online resources for learning about CSS and HTML syntax like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> for API info or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> for ideas, tutorials and keeping up with new stuff.</p>
<h4 id="6-You-should-have-a-basic-understanding-of-networking-and-HTTP-based-APIs"><a href="#6-You-should-have-a-basic-understanding-of-networking-and-HTTP-based-APIs" class="headerlink" title="6. You should have a basic understanding of networking and HTTP-based APIs"></a>6. You should have a basic understanding of networking and HTTP-based APIs</h4><p>Because we’re assuming that this job involves using JavaScript in a browser or other client context, you should be able to understand the basics of networking. You should know what a client and server is. You should be able to explain a rough approximation of what happens when somebody enters a URL into the browser<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-4">4</a>. There’s a bunch of vocabulary thats good to know here. You should know what an HTTP request is and ideally know the conventions of what GET/PUT/POST/DELETE imply. It will help you to have a working definition of what REST is and what AJAX is. It’s good to get experience working with some HTTP based APIs, either at work or playing around with an API like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github</a>. You should also get familiar with at least one way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript (XMLHttpRequest, fetch, jQuery’s ajax methods).</p>
<h4 id="7-You-should-be-comfortable-with-Node-js-based-tooling"><a href="#7-You-should-be-comfortable-with-Node-js-based-tooling" class="headerlink" title="7. You should be comfortable with Node.js based tooling"></a>7. You should be comfortable with Node.js based tooling</h4><p>One of the biggest shifts in the last 5 years in the JavaScript world has been the explosive growth and consolidation of tools to help build JavaScript applications. Tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://eslint.org/">eslint</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> are essential to many teams workflows. While you don’t necessarily have to be experienced writing applications for Node.js, it is important that you be able to use those tools. That means knowing how to install Node and use npm to install and update packages. It also means getting comfortable with build tools like Webpack, Rollup or Ember CLI and knowing how to use them. Reasonable people can differ on how many tools and libraries you should be using, or what the right ones to use are, but having a basic familiarity with how the Node ecosystem works has become essential.</p>
<h4 id="8-You-should-know-how-to-use-a-framework-to-structure-a-moderately-sized-program"><a href="#8-You-should-know-how-to-use-a-framework-to-structure-a-moderately-sized-program" class="headerlink" title="8. You should know how to use a framework to structure a moderately sized program"></a>8. You should know how to use a framework to structure a moderately sized program</h4><p>A critical requirement for a developer who is expected to complete work with minimum supervision or hand-holding is the ability to structure their code in a maintainable way. That means having an understanding of (or helping define) the overall architecture of the system, and then writing code that fits into it. It also means being able to identify and help solve situations where the current architecture or code base norms causes problems. I put this in terms of frameworks because pretty much all medium to large JavaScript programs are using some sort of framework, whether it is an “official” framework like React, Angular, and Ember or a collection of helper files and functions cobbled together by a development team over time. For learning purposes, the popular official frameworks will usually be better to learn, since the knowledge can translate elsewhere, the purposes behind the structure are documented on the internet, and at least some sense of best practice architecture should be embedded in the code. To check this box I think it would be best to get experience with at least 2 frameworks/architectures, since it is difficult to tell which decisions a Framework makes are specific to its architecture and constraints without something to compare it with.</p>
<p>This is probably the most controversial item on this list, since I know a lot of folks believe it’s better to learn architecture ideas outside the constraints of a framework. My stance here is that frameworks are practical: they’re most likely to translate to an actual employment background and it’s easy to find practical explanations of how they solve architecture problems.</p>
<h4 id="9-You-should-know-the-basics-of-JavaScript-program-performance"><a href="#9-You-should-know-the-basics-of-JavaScript-program-performance" class="headerlink" title="9. You should know the basics of JavaScript program performance"></a>9. You should know the basics of JavaScript program performance</h4><p>Like design, performance is a deep well of things you can learn. But knowing the basics is important and can go a long ways. For performance “the basics” is more about process than knowledge. You need to learn how to debug slow processes and understand where the problems are coming from. For browser environments in particular there are some baseline things to understand. You’ll want to be able to tell the difference between code that is running slowly due to parsing slowness, runtime slowness, and network latency. It’s important to learn how to keep a UI responsive and not block rendering with other calculations. And it’s great to understand how to cache data and avoid making too many requests to the server.</p>
<p>This is also an area where learning more about Computer Science theory can be beneficial. Studying data structures and algorithms can help give you good intuitions on how to handle data, and learning about Big O notation gives you a language for discussing performance tradeoffs. This is the type of background knowledge that pays off in occasional subtle ways though, not something that is always obvious applicable in the moment.</p>
<h4 id="10-You-should-have-a-process-for-learning-new-things"><a href="#10-You-should-have-a-process-for-learning-new-things" class="headerlink" title="10. You should have a process for learning new things"></a>10. You should have a process for learning new things</h4><p>JavaScript development has changed a lot over the last 10 years, and there’s no reason to think it won’t continue to evolve over the next 10. There are also a lot of different technologies that fall under the umbrella of JavaScript, more than any one person can keep in their head. So it’s important to be able to keep up with the new technologies as they come along, and also learn about new technologies quickly when you need them. Ideally this means having at least one place where you can follow news about new JavaScript innovation. Could be Twitter, a set of blogs, newsletters or an aggregator site like Reddit or Hacker News. If you’re looking for an easy place to start, I’d recommend the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>You also need to get comfortable finding information about specific technologies, either to learn to use them or troubleshoot problems. These resources will likely be more varied, but it’s important to learn to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://xkcd.com/627/">Google well</a>, and also helpful to get familiar with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> or some other resource for getting help when you have specific questions or problems.</p>

It’s something that took me the longest time to realise, and which has helped me the most on my developer journey. If you only take away 1 thing from this article, let it be this.</p>
<p>When you are new to the world of code, it makes sense to tread in the footsteps of others. At the time of writing, a quick “learning how to code” Google search brings up more than <em>10.6 billion</em> results! It’s safe to say that coding is gaining popularity and there are tons of platforms and resources, but with that also come millions of opinions on how to get started. Before you buy a handful of recommended books and courses, first answer this: <strong>What is the most effective way for you to learn new concepts?</strong></p>
<p>Do you prefer to learn through books or documentation? Video tutorials? Interactive tutorials? Or perhaps you prefer to immediately get your hands dirty by building small projects and to solve problems as you go.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure about which way is best for you, feel free to experiment with this and to try out different methods. <strong>Learning a new topic on your own offers the luxury of being able to fully personalise and customise your journey and curriculum — use this to your advantage and find something that works for you!</strong></p>
<h3 id="Don’t-be-afraid-to-drop-popular-resources"><a href="#Don’t-be-afraid-to-drop-popular-resources" class="headerlink" title="Don’t be afraid to drop (popular) resources"></a>Don’t be afraid to drop (popular) resources</h3><p>If you’re like me and don’t like to leave things unfinished, this can be a hard thing to do. I lost count of how many resources (books, online courses, etc.) I tried just because they were heavily recommended. Ultimately, I only ended up sticking with a handful of resources because many others did not suit my skill level (or preferred way of learning), or because the explanation was insufficient for me.</p>
<p>Are you not enjoying or learning much from a course that seems to be loved by everyone else? Don’t get discouraged or doubt your competence, or get stuck on a resource that you dislike. <strong>Drop it or save it for later if you feel like it’s only introducing more questions rather than answering them. There are always plenty of alternatives!</strong></p>
<h3 id="Slow-down-and-start-with-the-basics"><a href="#Slow-down-and-start-with-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Slow down and start with the basics"></a>Slow down and start with the basics</h3><p>It’s no secret that the tech industry moves <em>fast</em>. Blink twice and someone is suddenly mentioning a brand new framework, website generator or CMS; libraries and packages are continuously being released left and right.</p>
<p>This can be daunting and truth be told, it’s hard to keep up. If you’re self-studying, make sure you grasp the basics first. Don’t worry about not knowing React, and focus on understanding JavaScript first. There’s no need to look at Tailwind or Styled Components just yet—instead, prioritise becoming comfortable with writing CSS. Everything else will come in due time (spoiler alert: you don’t always need to work with the latest and greatest technologies!).</p>
<h3 id="Apply-your-growth-mindset-and-know-your-motivation"><a href="#Apply-your-growth-mindset-and-know-your-motivation" class="headerlink" title="Apply your growth mindset and know your motivation"></a>Apply your growth mindset and know your motivation</h3><p>Apply a growth mindset (“I can’t do this” vs. “I can’t do this <em>yet</em>”) and find the real reason(s) you want to learn how to code. What is it that you enjoy about it the most? What would you like to use your new skills for? Having your motivation clear will not only make learning more fun, but it will also make you more resilient in frustrating times when your code is not working as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Try not to compare yourself to other learners as everyone has their own timeline and techniques.</strong> Keep an eye on your goals, but don’t forget to look back sometimes and see how far you have already come. This may sound straightforward and obvious, but progress is not always immediately visible. Don’t be too harsh on yourself and enjoy the ride! Good luck!</p>

  <p>the creator of WordPress, spoke about JavaScript in his yearly keynote “The State of Word”. In it, he gave the WordPress community homework — to <strong>Learn JavaScript, Deeply</strong>. To go out and make 2016 the year that you finally take those steps into getting comfortable with JavaScript.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/KrZx4IY1IgU">https://youtu.be/KrZx4IY1IgU</a></p>
<p>To see Matt acknowledge this shift in the tech stack has me really excited and it confirms that JavaScript is exploding, and regardless of what you use to build your websites, JavaScript must be a major part of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take Every Opportunity to really beef up your JavaScript Chops — Mall Mullenweg, Creator of WordPress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, I know there are many developers in the WordPress community who have been just getting by stringing together themes, jQuery plugins and Stack Overflow answers. There are many developers who feel burned, who feel it’s too hard to learn or just something they can get by without. There will always be varying degrees of JavaScript involvement in your sites, but the one constant is that the types of sites and the interactive interfaces that you make with WordPress are happening more in the browser and are requiring some level of JavaScript knowledge to get going.</p>
<p>So — how do you learn JavaScript? My answer is always this: Build things, build things, build things!</p>
<p>And while this is a simple answer to give, and is one you will get from many experienced developers. It’s frustrating to hear, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You aren’t sure what you should build — either from lack of ideas, or that you aren’t 100% sure what you are capable of</li>
<li>You need at least some fundamentals before you can get started!</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer is still to find a project that you are excited about, and invested in and see it through to completion. Along the way you are going to need some resources that will help you out. I’m compiling a list of resources here. This will be a living list — if you have something that has helped you, or something you have created and would like it added, please leave a comment below and I’ll get it added to the site.</p>
<p>Go forth and learn JavaScript. Will it be hard? Yes! Is everyone else smarter than you and maybe JS just isn’t for you? No! JavaScript doesn’t have a learning curve, it’s more like learning mountains. It’s hard, but push through it with nothing but hustle and repetition and you’ll get it, trust me, I’ve seen this with hundreds of students at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hackeryou.com/">HackerYou</a>.</p>

  <p>TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.</p>
<p>For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, and <code>object</code>, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.</p>
<p>This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.</p>
<p>This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing on its type system.</p>
<h2 id="Types-by-Inference"><a href="#Types-by-Inference" class="headerlink" title="Types by Inference"></a>Types by Inference</h2><p>TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">let helloWorld &#x3D; &quot;Hello World&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F;  ^ &#x3D; let helloWorld: string</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. That’s how TypeScript knows that <code>helloWorld</code> is a <code>string</code> in the above example.</p>
<p>You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="Defining-Types"><a href="#Defining-Types" class="headerlink" title="Defining Types"></a>Defining Types</h2><p>You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. However, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming). To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.</p>
<p>For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes <code>name: string</code> and <code>id: number</code>, you can write:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const user &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: &quot;Hayes&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an <code>interface</code> declaration:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new <code>interface</code> by using syntax like <code>: TypeName</code> after a variable declaration:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: &quot;Hayes&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If you provide an object that doesn’t match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  username: &quot;Hayes&quot;,Type &#39;&#123; username: string; id: number; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Object literal may only specify known properties, and &#39;username&#39; does not exist in type &#39;User&#39;.Type &#39;&#123; username: string; id: number; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Object literal may only specify known properties, and &#39;username&#39; does not exist in type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an interface declaration with classes:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">class UserAccount &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  constructor(name: string, id: number) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    this.name &#x3D; name;</span><br><span class="line">    this.id &#x3D; id;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; new UserAccount(&quot;Murphy&quot;, 1);Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function getAdminUser(): User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  &#x2F;&#x2F;...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">function deleteUser(user: User) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  &#x2F;&#x2F; ...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>There are already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: <code>boolean</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>object</code>, and <code>undefined</code>, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as <code>any</code> (allow anything), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/unknown-and-never"><code>unknown</code></a> (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/unknown-and-never"><code>never</code></a> (it’s not possible that this type could happen), and <code>void</code> (a function which returns <code>undefined</code> or has no return value).</p>
<p>You’ll see that there are two syntaxes for building types: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?e=83#example/types-vs-interfaces">Interfaces and Types</a>. You should prefer <code>interface</code>. Use <code>type</code> when you need specific features.</p>
<h2 id="Composing-Types"><a href="#Composing-Types" class="headerlink" title="Composing Types"></a>Composing Types</h2><p>With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with Unions, and with Generics.</p>
<h3 id="Unions"><a href="#Unions" class="headerlink" title="Unions"></a>Unions</h3><p>With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. For example, you can describe a <code>boolean</code> type as being either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type MyBool &#x3D; true | false;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you hover over <code>MyBool</code> above, you’ll see that it is classed as <code>boolean</code>. That’s a property of the Structural Type System. More on this below.</p>
<p>A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of <code>string</code>s or <code>number</code>s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/literal-types.html">literal</a> that a value is allowed to be:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type WindowStates &#x3D; &quot;open&quot; | &quot;closed&quot; | &quot;minimized&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">type LockStates &#x3D; &quot;locked&quot; | &quot;unlocked&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">type OddNumbersUnderTen &#x3D; 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Unions provide a way to handle different types too. For example, you may have a function that takes an <code>array</code> or a <code>string</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function getLength(obj: string | string[]) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  return obj.length;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>To learn the type of a variable, use <code>typeof</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Type</th>
<th align="left">Predicate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">string</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof s === &quot;string&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">number</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof n === &quot;number&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">boolean</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof b === &quot;boolean&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">undefined</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof undefined === &quot;undefined&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">function</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof f === &quot;function&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">array</td>
<td align="left"><code>Array.isArray(a)</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For example, you can make a function return different values depending on whether it is passed a string or an array:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function wrapInArray(obj: string | string[]) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  if (typeof obj &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;string&quot;) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return [obj];&#x2F;&#x2F;          ^ &#x3D; (parameter) obj: string</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  &#125; else &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return obj;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="Generics"><a href="#Generics" class="headerlink" title="Generics"></a>Generics</h3><p>Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.</p>

<h2 id="Structural-Type-System"><a href="#Structural-Type-System" class="headerlink" title="Structural Type System"></a>Structural Type System</h2><p>One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type checking focuses on the <em>shape</em> that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural typing”.</p>
<p>In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.</p>

<p>The <code>point</code> variable is never declared to be a <code>Point</code> type. However, TypeScript compares the shape of <code>point</code> to the shape of <code>Point</code> in the type-check. They have the same shape, so the code passes.</p>
<p>The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object’s fields to match.</p>
