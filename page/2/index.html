          <p>Probably the most iconic video game company of the 1990s, id Software developed such groundbreaking titles as Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake. In a somewhat recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFziBfvAFnM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Romero</a> (the co-founder of id), outlined the company’s programming principles that allowed them to produce so many quality titles, one after the other, in a very short time, with a very small team.</p>
<p>Think of this as a companion to Lampson’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/acrobat-17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timeless paper</a> on system design. Many of the principles are common and they are all quite relevant today.</p>
<p>Although these programming principles refer to video game development, most (if not all) apply to general software development. In this blog post, I outline my own interpretation of these principles, paired with screenshots from Romero’s own slides for reference. I also make an attempt to generalize each principle beyond game development. Here we go.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-1-Just-do-it-and-do-it-well"><a href="#Principle-1-Just-do-it-and-do-it-well" class="headerlink" title="Principle 1: Just do it (and do it well)."></a><strong>Principle 1: Just do it (and do it well).</strong></h1><p>This doesn’t necessarily mean overly complicate your current version of the product. In fact, this may one way of describing the iterative development practice. Build something that does one thing really well and keep improving upon it constantly. Just keep your quality standards high in each iteration.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-2-Keep-your-code-always-runnable"><a href="#Principle-2-Keep-your-code-always-runnable" class="headerlink" title="Principle 2: Keep your code always runnable."></a>Principle 2: Keep your code always runnable.</h1><p>In his talk, Romero mentions how they had programmed the code to show an image of a bagel when the user hit an error loading a sprite. By adding good defaults/fallbacks, they made the game still playable. Had they not done this, the user would be blocked until the bug had been fixed (i.e. lost productivity hours). You can imagine how important this becomes as an engineering team grows larger. A practical example of this is using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#defaultprops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defaultProps</a> in ReactJS.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-3-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#Principle-3-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="Principle 3: Keep it simple."></a>Principle 3: Keep it simple.</h1><p>This is obviously not novel. Call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam' target="_blank" rel="noopener"s_razor">Occam’s Razor</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KISS principle</a>, keeping things as simple as possible is timeless great advice.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-4-Invest-time-in-building-great-tools"><a href="#Principle-4-Invest-time-in-building-great-tools" class="headerlink" title="Principle 4: Invest time in building great tools."></a>Principle 4: Invest time in building great tools.</h1><p>In his talk, Romero mentioned that he built a level editor called TED. The time he spent building TED paid hefty dividends, since it immensely helped them rapidly ship one game after the other by boosting productivity. Since those days, there has been an explosion of developer tools that have helped boost developer productivity. But if something off-the-shelf doesn’t cut it, try to identify whether an internal tool can help your developers be at their most productive (even if it can take development resources off the main product).</p>
<h1 id="Principle-5-Test-your-code-thoroughly"><a href="#Principle-5-Test-your-code-thoroughly" class="headerlink" title="Principle 5: Test your code thoroughly."></a>Principle 5: Test your code thoroughly.</h1><p>This covers many topics that many of the most effective engineering teams use as best practices: (a) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dogfood</a> your product as much as possible; (b) don’t delegate to others (e.g. QA engineers, or worse, customers) to find bugs in your code; (c) write as many tests as possible to accompany your code.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-6-Fix-bugs-as-soon-as-possible"><a href="#Principle-6-Fix-bugs-as-soon-as-possible" class="headerlink" title="Principle 6: Fix bugs as soon as possible."></a>Principle 6: Fix bugs as soon as possible.</h1><p>We are very strict about this at <a href="https://agentrisk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgentRisk</a>, a practice we’ve carried over from our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugsense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maginatics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startups</a>. During our daily stand-ups, we make sure that any new bugs have the highest priority and get fixed ASAP. Obviously, not all bugs are equal, so some business-related judgement is warranted here.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-7-Use-a-superior-development-system"><a href="#Principle-7-Use-a-superior-development-system" class="headerlink" title="Principle 7: Use a superior development system."></a>Principle 7: Use a superior development system.</h1><p>This is one that may mostly apply to game development. In other cases, you may want to go the other route when it comes to testing during development. For example, you may have users running your application on a mobile device that has very inferior specs, or they may be accessing your web application over a high-latency 2G connection. Make sure they don’t have a sucky UX.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-8-Write-code-for-this-version-of-the-product"><a href="#Principle-8-Write-code-for-this-version-of-the-product" class="headerlink" title="Principle 8: Write code for this version of the product."></a>Principle 8: Write code for this version of the product.</h1><p>This mostly translates to “don’t transfer over limitations of your past code and its implementation to future code”. This is a tricky one and kind of ties with Principle 4 . As engineers, we are often tempted to “rewrite everything” from scratch. This is where having experienced engineering leadership is really important. Often, the choice to take the plunge and do a new implementation can pay dividends down the line (similar to building tools). For example, as Slack started scaling, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/02/27/slack-frontend-architecture-with-anuj-nair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they scraped their v1.0 implementation entirely</a> and moved to a brand new architecture, reaping the rewards many times over. We also had a similar experience moving from Python to Elixir, having a much more robust codebase and much increased developer productivity.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-9-Use-good-component-abstractions"><a href="#Principle-9-Use-good-component-abstractions" class="headerlink" title="Principle 9: Use good component abstractions."></a>Principle 9: Use good component abstractions.</h1><p>This is really hard. If you have ever built and maintained an API, you know how hard it is to get it right (especially the first time). In his talk, Romero gives the example of encapsulate the functionality of a torch together with the flame and other related objects. Had they needed to move or update all torch instances in a level, having more a granular abstraction could have led to e.g. forgetting to move/update a flame. Spend a lot of time on this and try to get this right the first time. There will be compounding rewards in development and debugging time.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-10-Seek-feedback-from-peers-while-coding"><a href="#Principle-10-Seek-feedback-from-peers-while-coding" class="headerlink" title="Principle 10: Seek feedback from peers while coding."></a>Principle 10: Seek feedback from peers while coding.</h1><p>Using code review software can help with this. For more complex parts of a product, advance architecture review may be warranted. In any case, make sure you promote a culture that values communication and seeking feedback.</p>
<h1 id="Principle-11-Give-coders-creative-freedom"><a href="#Principle-11-Give-coders-creative-freedom" class="headerlink" title="Principle 11: Give coders creative freedom."></a>Principle 11: Give coders creative freedom.</h1><p>There are many ways to dice an onion. Give your coders the creative freedom to come up with their own solution to the problems they’re working on. Just make sure to enforce <em>some</em> coding standards, so that any member of the team can jump into the codebase. Getting caught up on coding aesthetics can waste valuable time, so it’s best to leave this to linters and auto-formatters. This does not mean that e.g. identifying suboptimal implementations in code reviews shouldn’t be encouraged. Just focus on things that are objectively wrong.</p>

          <h2 id="★第一步：WHAT"><a href="#★第一步：WHAT" class="headerlink" title="★第一步：WHAT"></a>★第一步：WHAT</h2><p>　　所谓的“WHAT”也就是“What is it?”——这是最简单的层次。在这个层次，你要搞清楚某个东东是【什么】样子的？有【什么】用处？有【什么】特性？有【什么】语法？……<br>　　举例如下：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>对于学习语言（比如 C++、Java、Python），大部分人都能够掌握基本的语法和标准库，然后用它写一些小程序（诸如二分查找、冒泡排序、简单文件操作等）。<br>对于学习类库（比如 JDBC 类库），大部分 Java 程序员都能明白 JDBC 主要包含哪些类，也能够用 JDBC 进行简单的数据库查询和增删改操作。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>　　由于这个步骤是最基本的，假如你连这都做不到（可能你的理解力不够好），也别在 IT 行业混了。<br>　　但是光会 What 是不够的。仅仅停留在这个步骤，导致了很多程序员【只知其然，不知其所以然】。这就是目前大部分开发人员的现状。</p>
<h2 id="★第二步：HOW"><a href="#★第二步：HOW" class="headerlink" title="★第二步：HOW"></a>★第二步：HOW</h2><p>　　所谓的“HOW”就是“How to do?”。在这个层次，你要搞清楚某个东西，其内部是【如何】运作的？【如何】实现的？……<br>　　举例如下：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>假如你在学习 C++ 语言，你是否搞明白函数传参数的实现机制？虚函数是如何实现？抛出异常时的栈回退是怎么回事？……<br>假如你在学习 Java 语言，你是否搞清楚 GC 如何实现？反射是如何实现？……<br>假如你在学习 JDBC 库，你是否清楚 JDBC Driver 的4种类型？不同游标类型的实现机制？事务的机制？……</p>
</blockquote>
<p>　　在这个阶段，你必须多想想类似这些问题。然后通过各种途径，把问题彻底搞清楚。自然而然，你的提高就会比较明显。而且如果碰到一些深层次的问题（比如性能优化），也就知道该如何去解决。<br>　　完成这个阶段之后，你基本上就属于该技术领域最优秀的20%的人（根据28定律，80%的人不会去思考 HOW 的问题）。</p>
<h2 id="★第三步：WHY"><a href="#★第三步：WHY" class="headerlink" title="★第三步：WHY"></a>★第三步：WHY</h2><p>　　一般来说，只有想清楚 HOW 之后，才能继续去考虑 WHY。<br>　　所谓的“WHY”，就是搞清楚某个东西【为什么】设计成这样？【为什么】不是另外的样子？这样的设计有什么讲究？……<br>　　说实在的，善于问“为什么”有一定的天赋成分？好像某个科学大牛曾经说过“提出问题有时候比解决问题更难”。一般来说，只有当你【深刻理解】了某个东西，才能够针对这个东东的【设计】问出一些问题。所以，我前面强调过，要先把 HOW 的问题搞清楚，再来考虑 WHY 的问题。<br>　　举例如下：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>对于C++语言：为什么 C++ 没有类似 Java 的 finally 关键字？为什么当初发明 C++ 的时候没有考虑 GC？……<br>对于Java语言：为什么 Java 没有类似 C++ 的类析构函数？为什么 Java 要同时提供 String 和 StringBuffer 两个似乎冗余的类？……<br>对于Python语言：为什么 Python 不提供类似 C++/Java 的访问控制机制？……</p>
</blockquote>
<p>　　如果你能够【自己】问出诸如上述的“为什么”问题，并且能够通过各种途径找到解答，那你基本上已经吃透这个技术了，并且你已经【有可能】自己去【设计】一个类似的玩意儿了。到这时，你已经踏上了通向技术高手的康庄大道。</p>

          <p>When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious. What will you say to high school students? So I asked them, what do you wish someone had told you in high school? Their answers were remarkably similar. So I’m going to tell you what we all wish someone had told us.</p>
<p>I’ll start by telling you something you don’t have to know in high school: what you want to do with your life. People are always asking you this, so you think you’re supposed to have an answer. But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab in a tide pool, to see what it does.</p>
<p>If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I’d say that my first priority was to learn what the options were. You don’t need to be in a rush to choose your life’s work. What you need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.</p>
<p>It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it’s hard to get an accurate picture of most jobs. Being a doctor is not the way it’s portrayed on TV. Fortunately you can also watch real doctors, by volunteering in hospitals. [1]</p>
<p>But there are other jobs you can’t learn about, because no one is doing them yet. Most of the work I’ve done in the last ten years didn’t exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world it’s not a good idea to have fixed plans.</p>
<p>And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don’t give up on your dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it, because it implies you’re supposed to be bound by some plan you made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don’t give up.</p>
<p>What they really mean is, don’t get demoralized. Don’t think that you can’t do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn’t underestimate your potential. People who’ve done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can’t help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject’s life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they’d seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.</p>
<p>Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that’s one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it’s not our fault if we can’t do something as good.</p>
<p>I’m not saying there’s no such thing as genius. But if you’re trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.</p>
<p>So far we’ve cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from “don’t give up on your dreams” to “what someone else can do, you can do.” But it needs to be cut still further. There is <em>some</em> variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist. If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I’d feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try. [2]</p>
<p>We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, “what someone else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don’t underestimate your abilities.” But as so often happens, the closer you get to the truth, the messier your sentence gets. We’ve taken a nice, neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle. It doesn’t make a very good speech anymore. But worse still, it doesn’t tell you what to do anymore. Someone with your abilities? What are your abilities?</p>
<p><strong>Upwind</strong></p>
<p>I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway.</p>
<p>In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don’t commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.</p>
<p>It’s not so important what you work on, so long as you’re not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you’ll take.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics it will be hard to get into grad school in math.</p>
<p>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn’t have an engine, you can’t fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for “don’t give up on your dreams.” Stay upwind.</p>
<p>How do you do that, though? Even if math is upwind of economics, how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?</p>
<p>Well, you don’t, and that’s what you need to find out. Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it’s probably worthwhile to join it. But it’s not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of faking going on.</p>
<p>To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look much the same. The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders. But while in some fields the papers are unintelligible because they’re full of hard ideas, in others they’re deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they’re saying something important. This may seem a scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified, in the famous <em>Social Text</em> affair. Suspecting that the papers published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary theory journal, which published it.</p>
<p>The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn’t. Hard means worry: if you’re not worrying that something you’re making will come out badly, or that you won’t be able to understand something you’re studying, then it isn’t hard enough. There has to be suspense.</p>
<p>Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think. What I’m telling you is that you should worry? Yes, but it’s not as bad as it sounds. It’s exhilarating to overcome worries. You don’t see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they’re so happy? Relief.</p>
<p>I’m not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.</p>
<p><strong>Ambition</strong></p>
<p>In practice, “stay upwind” reduces to “work on hard problems.” And you can start today. I wish I’d grasped that in high school.</p>
<p>Most people like to be good at what they do. In the so-called real world this need is a powerful force. But high school students rarely benefit from it, because they’re given a fake thing to do. When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to be a high school student. And so I let my need to be good at what I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.</p>
<p>If you’d asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I’d have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It’s that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.</p>
<p>If I had to go through high school again, I’d treat it like a day job. I don’t mean that I’d slack in school. Working at something as a day job doesn’t mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn’t think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn’t think of himself as a waiter. [3] And when I wasn’t working at my day job I’d start trying to do real work.</p>
<p>When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time. If you’re wondering what you’re doing now that you’ll regret most later, that’s probably it. [4]</p>
<p>Some people say this is inevitable — that high school students aren’t capable of getting anything done yet. But I don’t think this is true. And the proof is that you’re bored. You probably weren’t bored when you were eight. When you’re eight it’s called “playing” instead of “hanging out,” but it’s the same thing. And when I was eight, I was rarely bored. Give me a back yard and a few other kids and I could play all day.</p>
<p>The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now realize, is that I was ready for something else. Childhood was getting old.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t hang out with your friends — that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake, you’ll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it. And that’s what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness. [5]</p>
<p>You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades. We have to have <em>extracurricular activities.</em> But you know perfectly well how bogus most of these are. Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it’s not <em>hard.</em> It’s not getting something done. What I mean by getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life. This sort of thing rarely translates into a line item on a college application.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption</strong></p>
<p>It’s dangerous to design your life around getting into college, because the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience. At most colleges, it’s not the professors who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they are nowhere near as smart. They’re the NCOs of the intellectual world. They can’t tell how smart you are. The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.</p>
<p>Few parents would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn’t improve their admissions prospects. Prep schools openly say this is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to think about it, is that they can hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he went to the local public school. [6]</p>
<p>Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising college applicant. But that means you’re designing your life to satisfy a process so mindless that there’s a whole industry devoted to subverting it. No wonder you become cynical. The malaise you feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco industry executive feels. And you don’t even get paid a lot.</p>
<p>So what do you do? What you should not do is rebel. That’s what I did, and it was a mistake. I didn’t realize exactly what was happening to us, but I smelled a major rat. And so I just gave up. Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?</p>
<p>When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff’s Notes, it seemed par for the course. Surely it meant nothing to get a good grade in such a class.</p>
<p>In retrospect this was stupid. It was like someone getting fouled in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that’s against the rules, and walking off the field in indignation. Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just keep playing.</p>
<p>By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you. Yes, as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is crap. And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional. [7] So just keep playing.</p>
<p>Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don’t just do what they tell you, and don’t just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it’s pretty sweet. You’re done at 3 o’clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you’re there.</p>
<p><strong>Curiosity</strong></p>
<p>And what’s your real job supposed to be? Unless you’re Mozart, your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in? The word “aptitude” is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired tastes.</p>
<p>A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture under the name “passion.” I recently saw an ad for waiters saying they wanted people with a “passion for service.” The real thing is not something one could have for waiting on tables. And passion is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.</p>
<p>Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid curiosity. Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at random about everything. In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely. It has to: you can’t get anything done if you’re always asking why about everything. But in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep. The mud flat morphs into a well.</p>
<p>Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn’t a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.</p>
<p>One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it’s only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. So I was surprised when, early in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, not even a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it’s the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They’re all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they’re not interested in. One still hasn’t sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I’m often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don’t run for several days, I feel ill. It’s the same with people who do great things. They know they’ll feel bad if they don’t work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That’s why he’s so good.</p>
<p>If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell’s equations and said, what the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it can take years to figure out what a subject is really about. To take an extreme example, consider math. Most people think they hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name “mathematics” is not at all like what mathematicians do.</p>
<p>The great mathematician G. H. Hardy said he didn’t like math in high school either. He only took it up because he was better at it than the other students. Only later did he realize math was interesting — only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly.</p>
<p>When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it interesting. That’s what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that’s compellingly mysterious.</p>
<p>And not only in intellectual matters. Henry Ford’s great question was, why do cars have to be a luxury item? What would happen if you treated them as a commodity? Franz Beckenbauer’s was, in effect, why does everyone have to stay in his position? Why can’t defenders score goals too?</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong></p>
<p>If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one. Great questions don’t appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head. And what makes them congeal is experience. So the way to find great questions is not to search for them — not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can’t answer that; if you could, you’d have made it.</p>
<p>The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost. Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe. They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys. So when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to notice it.</p>
<p>Put in time how and on what? Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question. Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you’re deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)</p>
<p>It may be just as well not to do a project “for school,” if that will restrict you or make it seem like work. Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they’re not flakes. Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person), but secrecy also has its advantages. There’s something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if a project doesn’t seem to be on the path to some goal you’re supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you think. So let the path grow out the project. The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it’s by doing that you learn.</p>
<p>Don’t disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said that’s what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you’re not supposed to. Closely related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen year olds aren’t supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you’re doing no worse than expectations. [8]</p>
<p>Beware of bad models. Especially when they excuse laziness. When I was in high school I used to write “existentialist” short stories like ones I’d seen by famous writers. My stories didn’t have a lot of plot, but they were very deep. And they were less work to write than entertaining ones would have been. I should have known that was a danger sign. And in fact I found my stories pretty boring; what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers.</p>
<p>Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one’s work is only a small component of fame. I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool, and just done something I liked. That’s the actual road to coolness anyway.</p>
<p>A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don’t assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.</p>
<p>The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn.</p>
<p>Your life doesn’t have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. And you don’t have to wait to start. In fact, you don’t have to wait to be an adult. There’s no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age. [10]</p>
<p>This may sound like bullshit. I’m just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it’s restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.</p>
<p>The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don’t. That realization hits most people around 23. But I’m letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn’t how much time you wasted.</p>

I’ve tried to view this book through the eyes of a novice, but unfortunately I am biased by years of experience writing code in C. It’s obvious to me that either the author has a flawed understanding of C, or he’s deliberately oversimplifying to the point where he’s actually misleading the reader (intentionally or otherwise.)</p>

<p>“Learn C The Hard Way” is not a book that I could recommend to someone who is both learning to program and learning C.

          <p>LIKE most of my generation, I was brought up on the saying “Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.” Being a highly virtuous child, I believed all that I was told and acquired a conscience which has kept me working hard down to the present moment. But although my conscience has controlled my <em>actions,</em> my <em>opinions</em> have undergone a revolution. I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached. Every one knows the story of the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was before the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to the laziest of them. Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. This traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that after reading the following pages the leaders of the Y. M. C. A. will start a campaign to induce good young men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain.</p>
<p>Before advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must dispose of one which I cannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to engage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or she is told that such conduct takes the bread out of other people’s mouths, and is, therefore, wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be necessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths full of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns he usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man spends his income he puts just as much bread into people’s mouths in spending as he takes out of other people’s mouths in earning. The real villain, from this point of view, is the man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a stocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not give employment. If he invests his savings the matter is less obvious, and different cases arise.</p>
<p>One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some government. In view of the fact that the bulk of the expenditure of most civilized governments consists in payments for past wars and preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a government is in the same position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the man’s economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the money, even if he spent it on drink or gambling.</p>
<p>But, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in industrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed and produce something useful this may be conceded. In these days, however, no one will deny that most enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which might have been devoted to producing something which could be enjoyed, was expended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good to anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is, therefore, injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in giving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so would all those on whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and the bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for surface cars in some place where surface cars turn out to be not wanted, he has diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one. Nevertheless, when he becomes poor through the failure of his investment he will be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift, who has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a frivolous person.</p>
<p>All this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by the belief in the virtuousness of <em>work,</em> and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.</p>
<p>[inline_ad ad=2]First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth’s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind is capable of indefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders but those who give advice as to what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two different bodies of men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is not knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of the art of persuasive speaking and writing, <em>i.e.</em> of advertising.</p>
<p>Throughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more respected than either of the classes of workers. These are men who, through ownership of land, are able to make others pay for the privilege of being allowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might, therefore, be expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is rendered possible only by the industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable idleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work. The last thing they have ever wished is that others should follow their example.</p>
<p>From the beginning of civilization until the industrial revolution a man could, as a rule, produce by hard work little more than was required for the subsistence of himself and his family, although his wife worked at least as hard and his children added their labor as soon as they were old enough to do so. The small surplus above bare necessaries was not left to those who produced it, but was appropriated by priests and warriors. In times of famine there was no surplus; the warriors and priests, however, still secured as much as at other times, with the result that many of the workers died of hunger. This system persisted in Russia until 1917, and still persists in the East; in England, in spite of the Industrial Revolution, it remained in full force throughout the Napoleonic wars, and until a hundred years ago, when the new class of manufacturers acquired power. In America the system came to an end with the Revolution, except in the South, where it persisted until the Civil War. A system which lasted so long and ended so recently has naturally left a profound impression upon men’s thoughts and opinions. Much that we take for granted about the desirability of work is derived from this system and, being pre-industrial, is not adapted to the modern world. Modern technic has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves, would not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and priests subsisted, but would have either produced less or consumed more. At first sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus. Gradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an ethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of their work went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of compulsion required was lessened, and the expenses were diminished. To this day ninety-nine per cent of British wage-earners would be genuinely shocked if it were proposed that the King should not have a larger income than a working man. The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this is true; Athenian slave-owners, for instance, employed part of their leisure in making a permanent contribution to civilization which would have been impossible under a just economic system. Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was rendered possible only by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good. And with modern technic it would be possible to distribute leisure justly without injury to civilization.</p>
<p>Modern technic has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of labor necessary to produce the necessaries of life for every one. This was made obvious during the War. At that time all the men in the armed forces, all the men and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and women engaged in spying, war propaganda, or government offices connected with the War were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the general level of physical well-being among wage-earners on the side of the Allies was higher than before or since. The significance of this fact was concealed by finance; borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing the present. But that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat a loaf of bread that does not yet exist. The War showed conclusively that by the scientific organization of production it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world. If at the end of the War the scientific organization which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work had been preserved, and the hours of work had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that, the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry.</p>
<p>This is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances totally unlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been disastrous. Let us take an illustration. Suppose that at a given moment a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins as before. But the world does not need twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world everybody concerned in the manufacture of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?</p>
<p>The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich. In England in the early nineteenth century fifteen hours was the ordinary day’s work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very commonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busy-bodies suggested that perhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults from drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say, “What do the poor want with holidays? they ought to <em>work.</em>” People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much economic confusion.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Let us, for a moment, consider the ethics of work frankly, without superstition. Every human being, of necessity, consumes in the course of his life a certain amount of produce of human labor. Assuming, as we may, that labor is on the whole disagreeable, it is unjust that a man should consume more than he produces. Of course he may provide services rather than commodities, like a medical man, for example; but he should provide something in return for his board and lodging. To this extent, the duty of work must be admitted, but to this extent only.</p>
<p>I shall not develop the fact that in all modern societies outside the U. S. S. R. many people escape even this minimum of work, namely all those who inherit money and all those who marry money. I do not think the fact that these people are allowed to be idle is nearly so harmful as the fact that wage-earners are expected to overwork or starve. If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day there would be enough for everybody, and no unemployment — assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are already well-off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners except as the grim punishment of unemployment, in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons. Oddly enough, while they wish their sons to work so hard as to have no time to be civilized, they do not mind their wives and daughters having no work at all. The snobbish admiration of uselessness, which, in an aristocratic society, extends to both sexes, is under a plutocracy confined to women; this, however, does not make it any more in agreement with common sense.</p>
<p>The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education. A man who has worked long hours all his life will be bored if he becomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man is cut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the bulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish asceticism, usually vicarious, makes us insist on work in excessive quantities now that the need no longer exists.</p>
<p>In the new creed which controls the government of Russia, while there is much that is very different from the traditional teaching of the West, there are some things that are quite unchanged. The attitude of the governing classes, and especially of those who control educational propaganda, on the subject of the dignity of labor is almost exactly that which the governing classes of the world have always preached to what were called the “honest poor.” Industry, sobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages, even submissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover, authority still represents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, Who, however, is now called by a new name, Dialectical Materialism.</p>
<p>The victory of the proletariat in Russia has some points in common with the victory of the feminists in some other countries. For ages men had conceded the superior saintliness of women and had consoled women for their inferiority by maintaining that saintliness is more desirable than power. At last the feminists decided that they would have both, since the pioneers among them believed all that the men had told them about the desirability of virtue but not what they had told them about the worthlessness of political power. A similar thing has happened in Russia as regards manual work. For ages the rich and their sycophants have written in praise of “honest toil,” have praised the simple life, have professed a religion which teaches that the poor are much more likely to go to heaven than the rich, and in general have tried to make manual workers believe that there is some special nobility about altering the position of matter in space, just as men tried to make women believe that they derived some special nobility from their sexual enslavement. In Russia all this teaching about the excellence of manual work has been taken seriously, with the result that the manual worker is more honored than anyone else. What are, in essence, revivalist appeals are made to secure shock workers for special tasks. Manual work is the ideal which is held before the young, and is the basis of all ethical teaching.</p>
<p>For the present this is all to the good. A large country, full of natural resources, awaits development and has to be developed with very little use of credit. In these circumstances hard work is necessary and is likely to bring a great reward. But what will happen when the point has been reached where everybody could be comfortable without working long hours?</p>
<p>In the West we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no attempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce goes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all. Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle because we can dispense with their labor by making others overwork. When all these methods prove inadequate we have a war: we cause a number of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to explode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a combination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep alive the notion that a great deal of manual work must be the lot of the average man.</p>
<p>In Russia, owing to economic justice and central control over production, the problem will have to be differently solved. The rational solution would be as soon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for all to reduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to decide, at each stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be preferred. But, having taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult to see how the authorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much leisure and little work. It seems more likely that they will find continually fresh schemes by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future productivity. I read recently of an ingenious scheme put forward by Russian engineers for making the White Sea and the northern coasts of Siberia warm by putting a dam across the Kara Straits. An admirable plan, but liable to postpone proletarian comfort for a generation, while the nobility of toil is being displayed amid the ice-fields and snowstorms of the Arctic Ocean. This sort of thing, if it happens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of hard work as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in which it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is necessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life. If it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We have been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping the poor contented, which has led the rich for thousands of years to preach the dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in this respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us delight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth’s surface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker. If you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to say, “I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man’s noblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his planet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill in as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can return to the toil from which my contentment springs.” I have never heard working men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be considered, as a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure hours that they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy.</p>
<p>It will be said that while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not know how to fill their days if they had only four hours’ work out of the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world it is a condemnation of our civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the habit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into crime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable, because it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the desirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-turvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you with bread are praiseworthy because they are making money but when you enjoy the food they have provided you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to get strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is good and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one transaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good but keyholes are bad. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose of his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce between the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profitmaking is the incentive to industry. We think too much of production and too little of consumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer.</p>
<p>When I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning to imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure frivolity. I mean that four hours’ work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time should be his to use as he might see fit. It is an essential part of any such social system that education should be carried farther than it usually is at present, and should aim, in part, at providing tastes which would enable a man to use leisure intelligently. I am not thinking mainly of the sort of things that would be considered “high-brow.” Peasant dances have died out except in remote rural areas, but the impulses which caused them to be cultivated must still exist in human nature. The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part.</p>
<p>In the past there was a small leisure class and a large working class. The leisure class enjoyed advantages for which there was no basis in social justice; this necessarily made it oppressive, limited its sympathies, and caused it to invent theories by which to justify its privileges. These facts greatly diminished its excellence, but in spite of this drawback it contributed nearly the whole of what we call civilization. It cultivated the arts and discovered the sciences; it wrote the books, invented the philosophies, and refined social relations. Even the liberation of the oppressed has usually been inaugurated from above. Without the leisure class mankind would never have emerged from barbarism.</p>
<p>The method of a hereditary leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had been taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. It might produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and punishing poachers. At present, the universities are supposed to provide, in a more systematic way, what the leisure class provided accidentally and as a byproduct. This is a great improvement, but it has certain drawbacks. University life is so different from life in the world at large that men who live in an academic milieu tend to be unaware of the pre-occupations of ordinary men and women; moreover, their ways of expressing themselves are usually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that they ought to have upon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in universities studies are organized, and the man who thinks of some original line of research is likely to be discouraged. Academic institutions, therefore, useful as they are, are not adequate guardians of the interests of civilization in a world where every one outside their walls is too busy for unutilitarian pursuits.</p>
<p>In a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures may be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by sensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence needed for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will have lost the taste and the capacity. Men who in their professional work have become interested in some phase of economics or government will be able to develop their ideas without the academic detachment that makes the work of university economists lacking in reality. Medical men will have time to learn about the progress of medicine. Teachers will not be exasperatedly struggling to teach by routine things which they learned in their youth, which may, in the interval, have been proved to be untrue.</p>
<p>Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure delightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired in their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in professional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will not depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be unhampered, and there will be no need to conform to the standards set by elderly pundits. But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the advantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the opportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and less inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out, partly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe work for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen instead to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines. In this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish for ever.</p>

          <p>我通过观察发现这么一规律，人要想做好一件事，往往需要分两步，第一步是让自己处于可以把事做好的状态，第二步才是把事情做好。</p>
<p>你就好比说，我在博物馆给人讲解，如果一周之内我每天都讲，连续讲两周，我就嘴皮子特别利索，第一句话刚说出口，第三句话在脑中都已经准备好了，说话跟自动步枪似的，一个词汇在脑中往往有若干个同义词备选方案，我一边说前边的，一边在所有措辞方案中选出那个最恰当的说出来，表达的既流畅又精准。</p>
<p>但如果我两个星期不做这种高强度的讲解，我就能清晰地感觉到我的表达能力迟钝了，说话开始颠三倒四，有的词汇在嘴边绕圈，可就是抓不着，嘴在脑子前边，手又在嘴前边，有时候比划半天手势愣是说不出一句完整话，满头是汗。</p>
<p>再好比说，我知道一些职业作家，每天都会写个几百上千字的内容，其实写出来的东西也不错，但不给任何人看，写完之后关闭文件不保存，就上床睡觉了，他们要的就是保持那种写作的感觉，脑内和写作相关的神经回路得多走走电信号，要不容易迟钝。</p>
<p>其实仔细观察，体育、艺术、科研、社交等领域都是这样，那些真正惊艳的成就和突破，往往是在一种良好状态的惯性之上实现的，平时一直保持在80%左右，灵光一闪后撞穿天花板，抵达了110%，于是人就到了一个新的层次，所谓进步即是如此。</p>
<p>所以我觉得无论干什么，都先别想着做出成绩来，应该先想着如何让自己处于那种容易做出成绩的状态里并且稳住，指不定哪天灵光一闪或者突然顿悟，噌一下，人就上去了，成绩就有了。</p>
<p>灵光一闪这种事可遇不可求，等待是唯一的办法，但那一瞬间真正来临时，也只有持久的勤勉才能真正接得住它，本质来说，勤勉其实是一种正确的等待姿势。</p>
<p>“每天下班都看见他去图书馆自学，一副和自己过不去的样子，也不知道他这是图个啥。”</p>
<p>“他在等。”</p>
<p>“等什么？”</p>
<p>“等那个你接不住的东西。”</p>

          <p>事实上我上高中的时候也发现了这个现象，就是学习特别好的同学，是不记笔记的（也包<br>括后来的我）。</p>
<p>我先不讲这背后的理论原因，先讲一下我当时不记笔记时，心里是怎么想的。<br>当时班主任说每门课要准备一个笔记本，但是我发现实操根本不行，六个笔记本本身就增<br>加了管理，寻找笔记本的成本，另外，练习册和书那么多，根本就放不下那么多本子，所<br>以后来我决定只用一个本子记笔记，记所有科目，顿时觉得轻松了很多，这件事情也让我<br>逐渐相信，当自己的判断和老师相悖时，至少，要按照自己想的试一下。<br>再后来，生物老师布置的练习册有两本，一本叫状元之路，一本叫名师对话，老师要求两<br>本都要做，但是我发现这两本练习册里面有很多的重复题目，所以我在这时，想法就又和<br>老师不同了，我认为：在其它科目作业很多的情况下, 这两本练习册只要做一本就够。为什<br>么呢？就建立在一个最基本的想法上，就是做重复的题目没什么意义。这一次，我又坚信<br>了自己的想法，于是空出了比别人更多的时间，研究数学的圆锥曲线和导数。<br>我们的数学老师呢，上课基本上是这样的，就是他上课前先备课，准备好一大堆题目，然<br>后上课一道一道讲解，怎么讲解呢？每道题都要完整的抄在黑板上，然后所有同学紧跟着<br>老师，抄题，尤其是最后学统计的那块时候，一道题抄半个黑板，大部分都是废话，全<br>是“故事背景”，但是这个老师就真的全抄了，同学们也认真地一起抄，然后抄完一起做，<br>我保守估计一节课有 40% 的时间在抄题。这一次，我的看法又和同学老师不一样：我认为<br>抄题过程不动脑，对数学水平提升无意义，所以我不抄题，而这个“题”，也正是同学们<br>的“数学笔记”。</p>
<p>正因为如此，同学们的数学笔记都特别厚，每一个学期，都能抄一个大厚本，而自那时开<br>始，我就只关心那些我不会做的题目，或者说，我只抄那些我能从中学到新知识的题目，<br>如果所有的东西我都知道，我绝对不会再浪费这个时间抄它。我一直按照这个操作做，最<br>后高三基本上每次都是 140+，150 也不稀奇，我的高考数学也是 143。</p>
<p>从一开始，化学老师的上课方式我就感到很奇怪，她很唠叨，上课经常讲述她以前的一<br>些，和化学毫无关系的东西，不仅如此，她有很多教学上的坏习惯，比如我们有两个练习<br>册(和生物一样，也是状元之路和名师对话)，然后她上课一直让我们翻来翻去的，一会儿<br>让我们翻到名师对话第 XX 页，一会儿又让翻到状元之路 XX 页，最恶习的是她经常记错页<br>数，导致很多时间都浪费在了翻书上。她上课的效率，我保守估计，只有 15% 时间是有效<br>知识传输时间，而这 15% 是对全班来讲的，不一定对你有用，很可能你已经会了，所以很<br>可能最后只有 5% 是对你有用的。所以这时，我又和其他人不一样了：我大部分时间不听<br>这个老师讲，都是自己做题看题目解析，有问题去问我们学校另一个男老师。</p>
<p>对了，我还记得她说过一句话，叫“多做点题总没坏处”，这句话我的看法也和她不一样，<br>我认为她的这句话犯了一个典型的错误，叫“忽略成本只算盈收”，对于学生来讲，你的所<br>有成本就是 时间，而盈收，就是你实际的，做完这些题之后，比起你没做题时候，你的 增<br>量，所以如果你在一些问题上花太多时间，提升太少的话，那它很可能对你是 有害的，因<br>为你完全可以用这个时间干别的给你带来收益更大的事情。</p>
<p>语文更可笑，高三后期每个星期一次模拟考，考完之后呢，有一节课就是老师念成绩，黑<br>板上投影一个大大的 excel 表格，然后老师一个一个地念每个人的成绩，但我告诉你，即<br>便是这样，大部分同学也都是抬着头听老师念，自己什么都不做，我呢？当然不听了，自<br>己按照自己的计划学习，整理思路。</p>
<p>英语更好不哪去，高三的时候其实该讲的知识已经讲的差不多了，但是老师经常考一些同<br>学，就让这个同学站起来，考他，关键是这个时候大部分同学也不做自己的，就僵在那<br>里，什么都不干。我呢？当然还是在做自己的。<br>我上面说的所有判断，需要智商吗？完全不需要，所有人都能理解，但是终归像我那么做<br>的，也只是少数。</p>
<p>有的人总喜欢产生依赖情绪，依赖老师，依赖群体，所以跟着老师走自己什么都不管就好<br>了，于是自己变得没有主见，没有安排，逐渐丧失了学习本来的样子。<br>学习首先是个脑力劳动，有的人竟然能给你搞成体力劳动，我真的是服了。<br>事实上我不应该是少数，我本应该是大多数，因为我的做法，一点都不奇怪，正是学习本<br>来的样子。学习本来的样子自己给自己做规划，所有的目的都是为了把知识学好，这是唯<br>一目的，拒绝作秀，实事求是。</p>
<p>我最讨厌的就是不讲逻辑，凭空说出一句所谓的“道理”，你一问他为什么，他还说你钻牛<br>角尖，什么“记单词就要自己查纸质字典”，“只要跟着我走考试不会低于80”，毫无道理，<br>一句话说出来，让人无语。</p>
<p>我从来都不是什么智商高的人，反应总是比别人慢半拍，但至少，我没有做一个思维懒<br>惰，行动勤奋，自欺欺人，盲目跟风的人。</p>

          <h2 id="为啥都想速成？"><a href="#为啥都想速成？" class="headerlink" title="为啥都想速成？"></a><strong>为啥都想速成？</strong></h2><p>　　随便逛一下书店，你会看到《7天自学 Java》等诸如此类的 N 天甚至 N 小时学习 Visual Basic、Windows、Internet 的书。我用亚马逊网站的搜索功能，出版年份选1992年以后，书名关键词是：“天”、“自学”、“教你”，查到248个结果，前78个是计算机类图书，第79个是《30天学孟加拉语》。我用“天”换成“小时”，结果更惊人，有多达253本书，前77本是计算机图书，第78是《24小时自学语法句式》。在前200名中，96% 是计算机的书。</p>
<p>　　结论就是：要么人们急于学习电脑，要么计算机比其他东西学起来要异常简单。没有任何书是关于几天学习贝多芬或量子物理的，甚至连犬类装扮都没有。费雷森（Felleisen）等人在其著作《如何设计程序》中同意这个趋势，其中提到：“<em>坏设计很简单，笨蛋才用21天学，尽管他们还是真傻。</em>”</p>
<p>　　让我们看看《三日学会 C++》这个书名意味着什么：<br>　　“学习”<br>　　三天内你可能没有时间写出有意义的程序，或者从中积累经验。你不可能有时间去跟职业编程者一起去理解在 C++ 环境下的状况。简而言之，你没有充足的时间学很多。所以这本书只能说肤浅的知识。正如亚历山大·波普（Alexander Pope）所言：“<em>一知半解是很危险的</em>”。<br>　　“C++”<br>　　三天内你可能学会 C++ 的句法（如果你已经了解其他的语言），但你还不会使用它。打个比方，假如你是个 Basic 程序员，你可能写出 Basic 风格的 C++ 程序，而无法理解 C++ 的真实好处。那要点是什么？艾伦·佩里斯（Alan Perlis）曾经说过：“<em>一门不能影响你编程观点的语言不值得去学。</em>”有可能你学了一点点 C++（或者诸如 Javascript、Flex 之类），因为你需要和现成的工具接口以完成手头的任务。这种情况下，你不是在学习如何编程，只是在学习如何完成任务。<br>　　“三日”<br>　　不幸地是，这远远不够，下一部分会详细讲。</p>
<h2 id="如何用十年掌握编程？"><a href="#如何用十年掌握编程？" class="headerlink" title="　　如何用十年掌握编程？"></a>　　<strong>如何用十年掌握编程？</strong></h2><p>　　研究人员（Bloom (1985), Bryan &amp; Harter (1899), Hayes (1989), Simmon &amp; Chase (1973)）得出结论：想要在诸多领域达到职业水平需要十年，比如国际象棋，作曲，电报操作，绘画，弹钢琴，游泳，网球以及神经心理学和拓扑学的研究。<strong>关键是精心练习，只是一遍一遍地重复是不够的，必须挑战恰好超越你能力限度的事情，尝试并思考你的表现，并自我矫正。周而复始。</strong>这并无捷径！4岁的音乐奇才莫扎特用了13年才能创作世界级的音乐。另外，披头士乐队似乎在1964年的埃德·苏利文（Ed Sullivan show）演出中一炮而红，但是他们自从1957年就在利物浦和汉堡的酒吧演出，在取得广泛关注后，第一部重量级作品《佩珀军士》（Sgt. Peppers）是在1967年发行。</p>
<p>　　马尔科姆·格拉德威尔（Malcolm Gladwell）撰文描述了一项针对柏林音乐学院学生的研究，他们被分为尖子，中等和不足三类，并被问到他们练琴的情况：<br>所有三组中的人，开始学琴的年龄大概相差无几，五岁左右。在刚开始的几年，所有人练习量也差不多，一周两三个小时。自八岁开始，实质性变化就有了。那些精英学生开始比其他人练习更多：九岁的时候一周六个小时，十二岁的时候一周八个小时，十四岁的时候一周十六个小时，一直到二十岁的时候一周要超过三十小时。截止到二十岁，在他们的生涯里已经有总计一万小时练琴。仅仅表现可以的那部分学生加起来是八千小时，那些未来的音乐老师有四千小时。</p>
<p>　　所以，更确切地说，一万小时，而非十年，是个神奇之数。萨缪尔·约翰逊（Samuel Johnson，1709<del>1784）认为还需更长时间：“<em>卓越乃一生之追求，而非其它</em>”。乔叟（Chaucer，1340</del>1400）抱怨道：“<em>the lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne.</em>”（生之有限，学也无涯）。希波克拉底（Hippocrates，400BC）因这句话被世人所知：“<em>ars longa, vita brevis</em>”（译注：拉丁语，意为“艺无尽，生有涯”），更长的版本是：“<em>Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile</em>”，翻译成英文就是：“<em>Life is short, (the) craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult.</em>”（生有涯，艺无尽，机遇瞬逝，践行误导，决断不易）。</p>
<h2 id="我的编程成功秘笈是："><a href="#我的编程成功秘笈是：" class="headerlink" title="　　我的编程成功秘笈是："></a>　　<strong>我的编程成功秘笈是：</strong></h2><ul>
<li><p>首先要对编程感兴趣，能从编程中得到乐趣。<br>一定要让它足够有趣，因为你要保持你的兴趣长达十年。</p>
</li>
<li><p>与别的程序员交流。<br>阅读别人的代码——这比看任何书或参加培训课都重要。</p>
</li>
<li><p>实践。<br>最好的学习乃实践。俗话说：“<em>编程的至高境界一定要通过充分的实践才能达到，而个人的能力可通过不懈努力获得显著提升。</em>” (p. 366) “最有效率的学习需要明确的目标，适当的难度，知识回馈，并容许重复或修正错误。” (p. 20-21) 《实践认知：每日的思维、数学及文化》（Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday Life） 在这方面可做参考。</p>
</li>
<li><p>如果你愿意，花四年学习大学课程（或者再加上读研）。<br>这将给你赢得某些工作机会，并给予你在该领域的深层见解。但如果你不喜欢学校的学习，你同样可以在工作中获得相似的经验。无论如何，单靠书本是远远不够的。“学习计算机科学不会让你成为编程专家，如同学习绘画和色彩理论不会让你成为画家一样”。这是埃里克·雷蒙德（Eric Raymond）说的，他是《新黑客字典》（The New Hacker’s Dictionary）的作者。我雇用过的最优秀程序员，只有高中文凭。但他开发过许多伟大软件，有自己的新闻组，通过公司认股赚的钱就让他买下了自己的夜店。</p>
</li>
<li><p>和其他程序员一起参与工程项目。<br>在某些项目中担当最优秀程序员，在另一些项目中充当最差劲程序员。充当领头羊的时候，你要测试你领导一项工程的能力，并用你的视野来激发他人；如果在项目组中垫底，就应该学习其它牛人在做些啥，以及他们不喜欢做的（看他们把哪些活让给你做）。</p>
</li>
<li><p>继续别人的工程项目。<br>去理解先前程序员写的程序。学习如何理解并解决先前程序员没有考虑到的问题。思考你的程序该如何设计以便让之后的程序员更容易维护。</p>
</li>
<li><p>至少学6种程序语言。<br>其中包括一种支持类抽象的（Java 和 C++），一种支持函数抽象的（如 Lisp 或 ML），一种支持语义抽象的（Lisp），一种支援声明规范的（如 Prolog 或 C++ 模板），还有一种支援协程的（Icon 或 Scheme），另外一种支持并发的（Sisal）。</p>
</li>
<li><p>记住，在“计算机科学”里有“计算机”一词。<br>理解计算机执行你的代码的时候花费的时间。比如：从内存中取一个字（考虑有无缓存未命中情形），连续从磁盘读字，或者在磁盘中定位。</p>
</li>
<li><p>参加语言标准化工作。<br>这可能是有关 ANSI C++ 委员会，也可能是决定你编码风格是两格缩进或四格缩进。无论如何，你要知道其他人对语言的喜好程度，有时还要想想他们为什么喜欢这样。</p>
</li>
<li><p>知道自己应该在何时脱身于语言标准化</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>　　所有上述这些，很难通过书本的学习来达到。我头一个孩子出生时，我读了所有的“如何做”（How To）系列的书籍，却依然对育婴毫无头绪。30个月后，我第二个孩子出生，我还需要温习一下那些书吗？绝对不！相反，我完全可以参照个人经验，而结果相当有效。这更让我确信：我的经验胜过那些专家们写的上千页文字。</p>
<p>　　弗雷德·布鲁克斯（Fred Brooks）在《没有银弹》（No Silver Bullet）一文给出了寻找顶级设计师的三条建议：</p>
<ul>
<li>尽早系统地识别出顶级设计师。</li>
<li>分配一个人作为其职业规划的导师。</li>
<li>给予机遇让成长中的设计师互相磨砺。</li>
</ul>
<p>　　此处假定有部分人已经有成为伟大设计师的潜质，你所需的就是要诱导他们。艾伦·佩里斯（Alan Perlis）一针见血地指出：“<em>假如人人都可以学雕刻，那就得教米开朗基罗如何不去干雕刻。对于伟大程序员，也是如此。</em>”</p>
<p>　　所以，简单地买一本 Java 书，你或许能找到些有用的东西，但绝不会让你在24小时内甚至24天抑或24月内，成为行家里手。</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
          <p>大家总是问一个错误的问题：“我应该学习 C++ 还是 Java？”在本文中，我将告诉大伙儿：对于选择编程生涯真正需要关注的是哪些问题。</p>
<p>　　请注意，这篇文章的目标读者并不是那些已经做出自己选择的人。（对于这些人而言）你会继续自己的编程生涯，而不管别人会怎么说。因为它已经渗透到你的血液中，你已经无法摆脱。你已经知道答案：C++、Java、Shell 脚本、Python、还有其它一大堆的语言和技术，你都理所当然地会去学习。甚至有可能你才仅仅14岁，就已经知道好几种不同的语言。</p>
<p>　　问我这样的问题的人可能来自其他行业，或者来自诸如 Web 开发之类的领域。他们知道 HTML 是一种类编程语言，而且想尝试构建某些更大型的应用。但我特别希望，当你在问这个问题时，你已经意识到了想要在计算机领域取得成功，你需要掌握自学能力，而且永不停息。</p>
<p>　　<strong>在这个领域做得越多，我越觉得：软件开发比任何行业都更接近于写作。</strong>我们从来不知道是什么造就了优秀的作者，我们只知道什么时候我们会喜欢某个人的文字。编程不是一种工程，仅需要把东西从入口倒进去，然后再转动手柄。把软件开发看成确定性的，是一个诱人的想法。因为这个想法，人们总想搞出一些工具来帮我们开发出想要的软件。但是我的经验告诉我，事实并非如此——人的重要性远高于流程。而软件是否运行在一部精确的机器上已经越来越不重要了——这犹如测不准原理对人类的影响。</p>
<p>　　我的父亲是造房子的，小时候我偶尔会帮忙打下手，放放砖块之类。他和他的木工告诉我，他们是为我好才让我干这些活——这样我就不至于走入这个行业。事实确实是这样。</p>
<p>　　我们不妨把软件开发比作盖房子。造房子的人当然不可能完全一样。这些人里面有：混凝土工、屋顶工、管道工、电工、砖瓦工、水泥工、瓦片工、搬运工、粗木工、细木工。当然，还有工头。每个工种都需要相应的技能，这些技能都需要花时间和精力去掌握。跟软件开发一样，造房子也是一个“建立/推翻”的过程。如果你想很快地获得回报，你可能从搬运工和砖瓦工开始做，这样的话，你无需太多的学习曲线就可以获得回报。当需求很多时，你的工作会很稳固，甚至收入也可能提升——如果没有足够的人手的话。但是，一旦行情不妙，木匠甚至工头就可能把砖瓦工一脚踢开。</p>
<p>　　当互联网刚刚兴起时，仅仅是花一点时间学习 HTML，你就可以得到一份薪水丰厚的工作。但是当形势惨淡时，对于技能的要求更高了——HTML 程序员（就像搬运工和砖瓦工一样）第一个被抛弃了，而拥有更高技能的程序员则留了下来。</p>
<p>　　我想说的是：<strong>除非你准备活到老学到老，不然的话，不要进入这个行业！编程看起来似乎是一个高收入而又稳定的工作。但要做到这一点，唯一的途径是：始终让自己更有价值。</strong></p>
<p>　　当然，你总能找到例外。总有那么一些人，仅仅学了一门编程语言，就可以胜任留在一个岗位上，而不需要增长他的技能。但他们只是幸免于难而已，他们最终无疑是很脆弱的。为了不让自己变得脆弱，你需要持续的提高自己，通过阅读、加入用户组、参加研讨会……<strong>你学得越深入，你就越有价值，也就意味着你有更好的职业前景，可以配得上更高的薪水。</strong></p>
<p>　　另一个方法是：先大致了解这个领域，找到最适合你的地方。打个比方：我的兄弟对软件很感兴趣，也入了这行，只不过他的工作是安装、维修、升级电脑。他总是一丝不苟，所以当他把电脑搞好，一定会很完美——不光是软件，连电线都会被仔细地捆好。他总是生意兴隆，远超出他的精力所能及。他甚至都不用担心 .com 泡沫的崩溃。显然他的饭碗不容易被抢走。</p>
<p>　　我在高校里待了很久，甚至还在 UCLA（注：加州大学洛杉矶分校）进修博士学位，后来又幸运地终止了。我说“幸运”是因为我不再喜欢呆在学校，而我之前在高校待了那么久，只是因为我很享受它。但我所享受的，基本上是不务正业的东西——艺术和舞蹈课，在校报工作，还有一小撮计算机课程（之所以说计算机课程“不务正业”，是因为我本科是物理专业，研究生才是计算机专业）。虽然我在学术上远谈不上卓越（有意思的是很多当时也许不会接受我这个学生的学校现在却用我的书做教材）。我真的很享受作为学生的日子，当我完成博士课程，也许会以一个教授的身份终老一生。</p>
<p>　　但就如现在看到的，我在学校里最大的收获恰恰来自我那些“不务正业”的课程，它们拓展了我的思维，使之超越了“我们已经知道的东西”。在计算机领域中，你总是为某种目标而编程。你对目标了解得越多，你就做得越好。我遇到过一些欧洲的研究生，他们需要结合其它专业领域来搞编程，他们的论文需要解决这个专业领域的特定的问题。</p>
<p>　　<strong>了解编程之外的领域，将会极大得提高你解决问题的能力（就如同多学几种编程语言将极大地提高你的编程技能）。</strong>很多时候，我发现仅仅学习计算机专业的学生，比那些（除了计算机之外）拥有其它背景的学生，在思维上有更多的局限性。因为后者有着更严谨的思维，也不那么容易想当然。</p>
<p>　　有一次我组织了一次会议，其中一个议题是：理想的应聘者有哪些特征：</p>
<ul>
<li>把学习当成生活方式。比如：你应该知道不止一种语言，没有什么比学习一门新语言更能让你开阔眼界了。</li>
<li>知道如何获取知识</li>
<li>Study prior art</li>
<li>善用工具</li>
<li>学会把事情简化</li>
<li>理解业务</li>
<li>为自己的错误负责。“我就是这样的”是不能接受的托词。能找到自己的失误。</li>
<li>成为一个领导者，善于沟通和激励。</li>
<li>搞清楚你在为谁服务</li>
<li>没有绝对正确的答案（更好的方法总是存在的）。展示并讨论你的代码，不要带着感情因素——你的代码并不等于你本人。</li>
<li>明白完美是渐进的</li>
</ul>
<p>　　适当尝试一些冒险——尤其是能令人感到害怕的冒险。当你尝试之后，将体会到出乎意料的兴奋。（在冒险的过程中）最好不要刻意去计划某个特定的结果。当你过于注重结果，你往往会错过那些真正有价值的问题。我的冒险往往是这样开始的——“我们先做些试验，看看它会把我们带到什么地方”。</p>
<p>　　或许某些人会对我的回答感到失望，并回复我说：“是的，这很有趣也很有用。但我到底应该学什么？C++ 还是 Java？”<strong>我再重复一次：并不是所有的问题都有一个唯一的简单的答案。问题的关键不在于选择某个编程语言，然后掌握之。问题的关键在于：持续学习，并且很多时候，有不止一个选择。</strong>相信我所说的，你的生活会更精彩！</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
          <p>​        我的朋友曾对一位著名的操作系统专家说他想要设计一种真正优秀的编程语言。那位专家回答，这是浪费时间，优秀的语言不一定会被市场接受，很可能无人使用，因为语言的流行不取决于它本身。至少，那位专家设计的语言就遭遇到了这种情况。</p>
<p>　　那么，语言的流行到底取决于什么因素呢？流行的语言是否真的值得流行呢？还有必要尝试设计一种更好的语言吗？如果有必要的话，怎样才能做到这一点呢？</p>
<p>　　为了找到这些问题的答案，我想我们可以观察黑客，了解他们使用什么语言。编程语言本来就是为了满足黑客的需要而产生的，当且仅当黑客喜欢一种语言时，这种语言才能成为合格的编程语言，而不是被当做“指称语义”（denotational semantics）或者编译器设计。</p>
<h3 id="流行的秘诀"><a href="#流行的秘诀" class="headerlink" title="　　流行的秘诀"></a>　　<strong>流行的秘诀</strong></h3><p>　　没错，大多数人选择某一种编程语言，不是因为这种语言有什么独特的特点，而是因为听说其他人使用这种语言。但是我认为，外界因素对于编程语言的流行其实并没有想象中那么大的影响力。我倒是觉得，问题出在对于什么是优秀编程语言，黑客的看法与大多数的语言设计者不一样。</p>
<p>　　黑客的看法其实比语言设计者的更重要。编程语言不是数学定理，而是一种工具，为了便于使用，它们才被设计出来。所以，设计编程语言的时候必须考虑到人类的长处和短处，就像设计鞋子的时候必须符合人类的脚型。如果鞋子穿上去不舒服，无论它的外形多么优美，多么像一件艺术品，你也只能把它当做一双坏鞋。</p>
<p>　　大多数程序员也许无法分辨语言的好坏。但是，这不代表优秀的编程语言会被埋没，专家级黑客一眼就能认出它们，并且会拿来使用。虽然他们人数很少，但就是这样一小群人写出了人类所有的优秀软件。他们有着巨大的影响力，他们使用什么语言，其他程序员往往就会跟着使用。老实说，很多时候这种影响力更像是一种命令，对于其他程序员来说，专家级黑客就像自己的老板或导师，他们说哪种语言好用，自己就会乖乖地跟进。</p>
<p>　　专家级黑客的看法不是决定一种语言流行程度的唯一因素，某些古老的软件（Fortran 和 Cobol 的情况）和铺天盖地的广告宣传（Ada 和 Java 的情况）也会起到作用。但是，我认为从长期来看，专家级黑客的看法是最重要的因素。只要有了达到“临界数量”（critical mass）的最初用户和足够长的时间，一种语言就可能会达到应有的流行程度。而流行本身又会使得这种优秀的语言更加优秀，进一步拉大它与平庸语言之间的好坏差异，因为使用者的反馈总是会导致语言的改进。你可以想一下，所有流行的编程语言从诞生至今的变化有多大。Perl 和 Fortran 是极端的例子，但是甚至就连Lisp都发生了很大的变化。</p>
<p>　　所以，即使不考虑语言本身的优秀是否能带动流行，我想单单流行本身就肯定会使得这种语言变得更好，只有流行才会让它保持优秀。编程语言的最高境界一直在发展之中。虽然语言的核心功能就像大海的深处，很少有变化，但是函数库和开发环境之类的东西就像大海的表面，一直在汹涌澎湃。</p>
<p>　　当然，黑客必须先知道这种语言，才可能去用它。他们怎么才能知道呢？就是从其他黑客那里。所以不管怎样，一开始必须有一群黑客使用这种语言，然后其他人才会知道它。我不知道“一群”的最小数量是多少，多少个黑客才算达到“临界数量”呢？如果让我猜，我会说20人。如果一种语言有20个独立用户，就意味着有20个人是自主决定使用这种语言的，我觉得这就说明这种语言真的有优点。</p>
<p>　　达到这一步并非易事。如果说用户数从0到20比从20到1000更困难，我也不会感到惊讶。发展最早的20个用户的最好方法可能就是使用特洛伊木马：你让人们使用一种他们需要的应用程序，这个程序碰巧就是用某种新语言开发的。</p>
<h3 id="外部因素"><a href="#外部因素" class="headerlink" title="　　外部因素"></a>　　<strong>外部因素</strong></h3><p>　　我们得先承认，确实有一个外部因素会影响到语言的流行。一种语言必须是某一个流行的计算机系统的脚本语言（scripting language），才会变得流行。Fortran 和 Cobol 是早期 IBM 大型机的脚本语言。C 是 Unix 的脚本语言，后来的 Perl 和 Python 也是如此。Tcl 是 Tk 的脚本语言，Visual Basic 是 Windows 的脚本语言,（某种形式的）Lisp 是 Emacs 的脚本语言，PHP 是网络服务器的脚本语言，Java 和 JavaScript 是浏览器的脚本语言。</p>
<p>　　编程语言不是存在于真空之中。“编程”其实是及物动词，黑客一般都是为某个系统编程，在现实中，编程语言总是与它们依附的系统联系在一起的。所以，如果你想设计一种流行的编程语言，就不能只是单纯地设计语言本身，还必须为它找到一个依附的系统，而这个系统也必须流行。除非你只想用自己设计的语言取代那个系统现有的脚本语言。</p>
<p>　　这种情况导致的一个结果就是，无法以一种语言本身的优缺点评判这种语言。另一个结果则是，只有当一种语言是某个系统的脚本语言时，它才能真正成为编程语言。如果你对此很吃惊，觉得不公平，那么我会跟你说不必大惊小怪。这就好比大家都认为，如果一种编程语言只有语法规则，没有一个好的实现（implementation），那么它就不能算完整的编程语言。这些都是很正常很合理的事情，编程语言本来就该如此。</p>
<p>　　当然，编程语言本来就需要一个好的实现，而且这个实现必须是免费的。商业公司愿意出钱购买软件，但是黑客作为个人不会愿意这样做，而你想让一种语言成功，恰恰就是需要吸引黑客。</p>
<p>　　编程语言还需要有一本介绍它的书。这本书应该不厚，文笔流畅，而且包含大量优秀的范例。布赖恩·柯尼汉和丹尼斯·里奇合写的《C 程序设计语言》（C Programming Language）就是这方面的典范。眼下，我大概还能再加一句，这一类书籍之中必须有一本由 O’Reilly 公司出版发行。这正在变成是否能吸引黑客的前提条件了。</p>
<p>　　编程语言还应该有在线文档。事实上，在线文档可以当做一本书来写，但是目前它还无法取代实体书。实体书并没有过时，它们读起来很方便，而且出版社对书籍内容的审核是一种很有用的质量保证机制（虽然做得很不完美）。书店则是程序员发现和学习新语言的最重要的场所之一。</p>
<h3 id="简洁"><a href="#简洁" class="headerlink" title="　　简洁"></a>　　<strong>简洁</strong></h3><p>　　假定你的语言已经能够满足上面三项条件——一种免费的实现，一本相关书籍，以及语言所依附的计算机系统——那么还需要做什么才能使得黑客喜欢上你的语言？</p>
<p>　　黑客欣赏的一个特点就是简洁。黑客都是懒人，他们同数学家和现代主义建筑师一样，痛恨任何冗余的东西或事情。有一个笑话说，黑客动手写程序之前，至少会在心里盘算一下哪种语言的打字工作量最小，然后就选择使用该语言。这个笑话其实与真实情况相差无几。就算这真的是个笑话，语言的设计者也必须把它当真，按照它的要求设计语言。</p>
<p>　　简洁性最重要的方面就是要使得语言更抽象。为了达到这一点，首先你设计的必须是高级语言，然后把它设计得越抽象越好。语言设计者应该总是看着代码，问自己能不能使用更少的语法单位把它表达出来。如果你有办法让许多不同的程序都能更简短地表达出来，那么这很可能意味着你发现了一种很有用的新抽象方法。</p>
<p>　　不要觉得为用户着想就是让他们使用像英语一样又长又啰唆的语法。这是不正确的做法，Cobol 就是因为这个毛病而声名狼藉。</p>
<p>　　如果你让黑客像下面这样求和：<br><code>add x to y giving z</code></p>
<p>　　而不是写成：<br><code>z = x + y</code></p>
<p>　　那么你就是在侮辱黑客的智商，或者自己作孽了。</p>
<p>　　简洁性是静态类型语言的力所不及之处。不考虑其他因素时，没人愿意在程序的头部写上一大堆的声明语句。只要计算机可以自己推断出来的事情，都应该让计算机自己去推断。举例来说，“hello world”本应该是一个很简单的程序，但是在 Java 语言中却要写上一大堆东西，这本身就差不多可以说明 Java 语言设计得有问题了。</p>
<p>　　单个的语法单位也应该很简短。Perl 和 Common Lisp 在这方面是两个不同的极端。Perl 的语法单位很短，导致它的代码可以拥挤得让人无法理解，而 Common Lisp 内置运算符的名称则长得可笑。Common Lisp 的设计者们可能觉得文本编辑器会帮助用户自动填写运算符的长名称。但是这样做的代价不仅是增加了打字的工作量，还包括提高了阅读代码的难度，以及占用了更多的显示器空间。</p>
<h3 id="可编程性（Hackability）"><a href="#可编程性（Hackability）" class="headerlink" title="　　可编程性（Hackability）"></a>　　<strong>可编程性（Hackability）</strong></h3><p>　　对黑客来说，选择编程语言的时候，还有一个因素比简洁更重要，那就是这种语言必须能够帮助自己做到想做的事。在编程语言的历史上，防止程序员做出“错误”举动的措施多得惊人。这是语言设计者很自以为是的危险举动，他们怎么知道程序员该做什么不该做什么？我认为，语言设计者应该假定他们的目标用户是一个天才，会做出各种他们无法预知的举动，而不是假定目标用户是一个笨手笨脚的傻瓜，需要别人的保护才不会伤到自己。如果用户真的是傻瓜，不管你怎么保护他，他还是会搬起石头砸自己的脚。你也许能够阻止他引用另一个模块中的变量，但是你没法防止他日日夜夜不知疲倦地写出结构混乱的程序去解决完全错误的问题。</p>
<p>　　优秀程序员经常想做一些既危险又令人恼火的事情。所谓“令人恼火”，我指的是他们会突破设计者提供给用户的外部语义层，试着控制某些高级抽象的语言内部接口。比如，黑客喜欢破解，而破解就意味着深入内部，揣测原始设计者的意图。</p>
<p>　　你应该敞开胸怀，欢迎这种揣测。对于制造工具的人来说，总是会有用户以违背你本意的方式使用你的工具。如果你制造的是编程语言这样高度组合的系统，那就更是如此了。许多黑客会用你做梦也想不到的方式改动你的语法模型。我的建议就是，让他们这样干吧，而且应该为他们创造便利，尽可能多地把语言的内部暴露在他们面前。</p>
<p>　　其实，黑客并不会彻底颠覆你的工具，在一个大型程序中，他可能只是对语言改造一两个地方。但是，改动多少地方并不重要，重要的是他能够对语言进行改动。这可能不仅有助于解决一些特殊的问题，还会让黑客觉得很好玩。黑客改造语言的乐趣就好比外科医生摆弄病人内脏的乐趣，或者青少年喜欢用手挤破青春痘的那种感觉。至少对男生来说，某些类型的破坏非常刺激。针对青年男性读者的 Maxim 杂志每年出版一本特辑，里面一半是美女照片，另一半是各种严重事故的现场照片。这本杂志非常清楚它的读者想看什么。</p>
<p>　　一种真正优秀的编程语言应该既整洁又混乱。“整洁”的意思是设计得很清楚， 内核由数量不多的运算符构成，这些运算符易于理解，每一个都有很完整的独立用途。“混乱”的意思是它允许黑客以自己的方式使用。C 语言就是这样的例子，早期的 Lisp 语言也是如此。真正的黑客语言总是稍微带一点放纵不羁、不服管教的个性。</p>
<p>　　优秀的编程语言所具备的功能，应该会使得言必称“软件工程”的人感到非常不满、频频摇头。与黑客语言形成鲜明对照的就是像 Pascal 那样的语言，它是井然有序的模范，非常适合教学，但是除此之外就没有很大用处了。</p>
<p>　　<strong>一次性程序</strong></p>
<p>　　为了吸引黑客，一种编程语言必须善于完成黑客想要完成的各种任务。这意味着它必须很适合开发一次性程序。这一点可能出乎很多人的意料。</p>
<p>　　所谓一次性程序，就是指为了完成某些很简单的临时性任务而在很短时间内写出来的程序。比如，自动完成某些系统管理任务的程序，或者（为了某项模拟任务）自动生成测试数据的程序，以及在不同格式之间转化数据的程序等。令人吃惊的是，一次性程序往往不是真的只用一次，就像二战期间很多美国大学造的一大批临时建筑后来都成了永久建筑。许多一次性程序后来也都变成了正式的程序，具备了正式的功能和外部用户。</p>
<p>　　我有一种预感，最优秀的那些大型程序就是这样发展起来的，而不是像胡佛水坝那样从一开始就作为大型工程来设计。一下子从无到有做出一个大项目是一件很恐怖的事。当人们接手一个巨型项目时，很容易被它搞得一蹶不振。最后，要么是项目陷入僵局，要么是做出来一个规模小、性能差的东西。你想造一片闹市，却只做出一家商场；你想建一个罗马，却只造出一个巴西利亚；你想发明 C 语言，却只开发出 Ada。</p>
<p>　　开发大型程序的另一个方法就是从一次性程序开始，然后不断地改进。这种方法比较不会让人望而生畏，程序在不断的开发之中逐渐进步。一般来说，使用这种方法开发程序，一开始用什么编程语言，就会一直用到最后，因为除非有外部政治因素的干预，程序员很少会中途更换编程语言。所以，我们就有了一个看似矛盾的结论：如果你想设计一种适合开发大型项目的编程语言，就必须使得这种语言也适合开发一次性程序，因为大型项目就是从一次性程序演变而来的。</p>
<p>　　Perl 就是一个鲜明的例子。它不仅仅设计成适合开发一次性程序，而且它本身就很像一次性程序。最初的 Perl 只是好几个生成表格的工具收集在一起而已。后来程序员用它写一次性程序，当那些程序逐渐发展壮大后，Perl 才随之发展成了一种正式的编程语言。到了 Perl 5，这种语言才适合开发重要的程序，但是在此之前它已经广为流行了。</p>
<p>　　什么样的语言适合写一次性程序？首先，它必须很容易装备。一次性程序是你只想在一小时内写出来的程序，所以它不应该耗费很多时间安装和配置，最好已经安装在你的电脑上了。它必须是想用就用的。C 语言可以想用就用，因为它是操作系统的一部分；Perl 可以想用就用，因为它本来就是一种系统管理工具，操作系统已经默认安装它了。</p>
<p>　　很容易装备不仅仅指很容易安装或者已经安装，还指很容易与使用者互动。一种有命令行界面、可以实时反馈的语言就具有互动性，那些必须先编译后使用的语言就不具备互动性。受欢迎的编程语言应该是前者，具有良好的互动性，可以快速得到运行结果。</p>
<p>　　一次性程序的另一个特点就是简洁。对黑客来说，这一点永远有吸引力。如果考虑到你最多只打算在这个程序上耗费一个小时，这一点就更重要了。</p>
