<li>Always Keep learning<br>Telling yourself that you don’t know something is the first step towards learning something new. Often experienced programmers find it hard to identify areas where they lack because they believe that they know everything. Learn from everyone and everything that comes your way as it will help you become a better coder.</li>
<li>Improve with experience<br>To be great at something you must learn from your mistakes. We become better at a task with experience. However, it is true only when we learn from our experience and try to improve on ourselves. Staying with the same mindset and beliefs won’t make you any better. As a programmer always strive to do better than before as it will help you gain experience in a real sense.</li>
<li>Seek for perfection<br>Often we stop once we think that we have achieved the goal. Programmers often focus only on writing quality codes and most of them stop when they feel it is done. However, to be a better programmer you must understand that codes are never perfect, work is required to make them perfect. Always strive to look for perfection, it might mean making the product faster, reliable, feature-packed but there is always room for improvement.</li>
<li>Write it thrice<br>Good programmers usually write codes many times till they are satisfied that they have achieved their goals to some extent. It is advised that you work on your codes thrice at least. The first time you write you make yourself believe that the idea can be out to practice. The second time when you work on it you actually strive to bring out all that is expected from the solution. The third time should be focused on making it perfect. There are always many approaches to the problem but there is always the best solution. Work till you find the perfect way out.</li>
<li>Read codes<br>Just like reading is important to expand your wisdom. In coding, reading what other programmers have written is quite important. Codes can be written in many ways, and there is of course no one right way. When you read others code you learn about other possibilities that you may otherwise be not aware of. It is also a great way to brush up and improve your programming skills. Interact with other coders whenever possible, participate in coding forums and learn from these experiences.</li>

  <p>I think this is a great question if you take it seriously, because when you think about it critically, it exposes all of the things JavaScript don’t really <strong>need</strong> to know. Can you contribute productively as a mid-level JavaScript developer without knowing anything about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>? Sure! Can you contribute productively if you’re writing and testing your JavaScript using *&lt;awful uncool code editor that you the reader can’t stand&gt;*? Definitely. So here’s my take on answering the question.</p>
<h2 id="Assumptions"><a href="#Assumptions" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a>Assumptions</h2><p>I’m making the following assumptions about the question</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I’m assuming the audience is a developer who has some level of professional programming experience and some existing JavaScript experience, and that they are primarily interested in “code skill” answers. Thus I’ll exclude things like communication ability, experience with version control, professional conduct, or basic coding ability that are very important to success in a JavaScript development environment but are out of the scope of this question.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I’m optimizing for “what specific pre-existing knowledge will make the most difference between success and failure for a new hire in a mid-level JavaScript role”.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-existing</strong> means that these are things that somebody is expected to know before taking the job. Learning the details of a company’s technology stack, style guide and engineering philosophy are all important, but you shouldn’t be expected to know them in advance, and in many cases doing so is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Specific knowledge</strong> means that these are things that you can learn with some effort and study. They should not be broad categories like “security”, “design”, or “server-side development”. They should be things you know or know how to do, not things you “have experience with”. And they should be specific enough that somebody can feel comfortable saying they understand the topic or don’t. Most of the things I list below are <em>topics</em>, but I try to lay out a specific set of things that you would need to know to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>The most difference between success and failure</strong> means that these are the things that are really going to make a difference in how effective you are at understanding and completing the work assigned to you. There are many such things, and their importance will vary situationally, so this is just my educated take on a generalists list.</p>
<p>When I say <strong>mid-level</strong>, I’m picturing hiring for a role that pays well but is not the most senior person on the team. This would be a developer who would be expected to complete tasks with minimal help and oversight but wouldn’t necessarily be planning the architecture of everything right off the bat. To be clear this list is not a set of things that you need to go to get paid to write JavaScript. It is more along the lines of “next steps” for junior devs. Its also not a step function where you need to know all of these at once to get to the next level. These are just things that may limit you if you don’t have them.</p>
<p>I’m taking the liberty to assume that <strong>JavaScript role</strong> implies using JavaScript in some sort of client/UI environment (Browser, React Native, Cordova, Electron, etc). This list would be at least a bit different for a Node.js server-side role, and somebody else will have to write that post.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="The-List"><a href="#The-List" class="headerlink" title="The List"></a>The List</h2><h4 id="1-You-should-know-the-core-language"><a href="#1-You-should-know-the-core-language" class="headerlink" title="1. You should know the core language"></a>1. You should know the core language</h4><p>JavaScript is not a very complicated language at its core. It can seem difficult to learn because of all of the noise around it. Browser APIs, Library APIs, jQuery, React, TypeScript, the many npm packages out there, etc all can make the language syntax space seem huge. And this isn’t helped by the fact that the language has evolved over time so you’ll see many different ways to do a single task spread out over the internet. But the core language and standard libraries are actually pretty small compared to languages like Python and Java that have more features and larger standard libraries. Eventually you’ll need the ecosystem. But knowing the core language features that are implemented in most browsers is a great start.</p>
<p>This means you should know about basic language features like if/else, error handling with throw/try/catch, array manipulation with push/map/reduce/filter, and string manipulation methods like replace/slice/split. You should also know about how JavaScript handles things like truthiness and falsiness<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-1">1</a>, how to work with JSON data with the JSON object methods, and how variable scope works in JavaScript. These days its also becoming more and more important to have at least a basic familiarity with the more important language features that were added in ES6 like Promises, modules, classes, template literals, generators and destructuring. Even if you choose not to use those features, being able to see and understand them will help you learn faster from others.</p>
<p>This list is mostly unordered, but this comes first because learning everything else becomes a lot harder without this knowledge, mostly because it becomes difficult to learn from other people’s code since you won’t understand what it is doing. If you’re starting from a weak base here I’d recommend finding a good book on the core language like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2uD4R1Y">Eloquent JavaScript</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-2">2</a> and digging in. If you’ve been using JavaScript in an older code base or haven’t used it in a while and want to catch up, you can see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/">my post on keeping up with new language features</a>.</p>
<h4 id="2-You-should-understand-async-code"><a href="#2-You-should-understand-async-code" class="headerlink" title="2. You should understand async code"></a>2. You should understand async code</h4><p>One of the biggest leaps for new JavaScript developers, even those who are experienced with other languages is the amount of asynchronous code found in idiomatic JavaScript. Asynchronous (async) code is code that is scheduled to run at a later time after some event, delay or response. It can appear a bunch of different ways in JavaScript code, and it’s important to be able to interpret them.</p>
<p>This means learning about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2015/12/30/es6-patterns-converting-callbacks-to-promises/">callbacks and promises</a> at least. You should also learn about the JavaScript <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/10/27/the-javascript-event-loop-explained/">event loop</a> and how it works Ideally some of the standard APIs that use them like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Talk:DOM/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch">fetch</a>. If you’re ambitious you can learn about newer async syntax and library implementations like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await">async-await</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">RxJS</a> But the most important thing is to spend time using and writing async code so that you get an intuitive understanding of how it works.</p>
<h4 id="3-You-should-get-comfortable-with-at-least-one-set-of-developer-tools"><a href="#3-You-should-get-comfortable-with-at-least-one-set-of-developer-tools" class="headerlink" title="3. You should get comfortable with at least one set of developer tools"></a>3. You should get comfortable with at least one set of developer tools</h4><p>When developing JavaScript, its important to be able to debug problems and understand how existing systems work. JavaScript has a fantastic ecosystem of developer tools for diagnosing bugs and examining application code. For the most part they’re bundled with browsers (though some IDEs like VS Code and WebStorm have their own debuggers). Learning how to use these tools well will turbocharge your JS dev skills. If you can’t use them though, it will make everything much harder.</p>
<p>Competence in this means comfort with at least the JavaScript debugger panel of a browser’s devtools. You should be able to set and use breakpoints, use watch mode and the console to test for the value of expressions, and understand the stack traces. But its also good to get comfortable using the elements panel to understand and manipulate the DOM, and the network panel to debug network requests.</p>
<h4 id="4-You-should-be-proficient-with-JavaScript-functions"><a href="#4-You-should-be-proficient-with-JavaScript-functions" class="headerlink" title="4. You should be proficient with JavaScript functions"></a>4. You should be proficient with JavaScript functions</h4><p>Functions are the core of the JavaScript language. You should be able to use them fluently. That means understanding function scope, closures, how <code>this</code> works, and the difference between normal functions and arrow functions. It also means knowing about how to process arrays with function using methods like map, filter, and reduce. A good resource for “thinking in functions” is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read">JavaScript Allonge</a> by Reginald Braithwaite.</p>
<h4 id="5-You-should-be-comfortable-with-basic-design-tasks"><a href="#5-You-should-be-comfortable-with-basic-design-tasks" class="headerlink" title="5. You should be comfortable with basic design tasks"></a>5. You should be comfortable with basic design tasks</h4><p>No matter how well you learn JavaScript, you’ll be limited career-wise if you can’t manage basic design tasks. This might not seem inherently true; after all isn’t that what professional designers are for? But the truth is that unless you’re a purely server-side developer (excluded by our assumptions above), there will be times when you’re asked to fill in a visual gap that a designer doesn’t have time for, or there will be ambiguities in a designers spec that aren’t worth a meeting. And learning the basics of design will help you communicate better with designers and product managers about technical constraints and design requirements.</p>
<p>When I talk design, I mean both the basics of implementing a visual design with HTML and CSS<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-3">3</a>, and enough of an understanding of design basics to create a simple UI that looks ok and isn’t confusing. That last requirement is harder than you’d think. Design is hard and mostly orthogonal to the set of skills most folks pick up while learning to code. For learning design theory, I’d recommend finding a simple resource on visual design first like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2uz3vEG">White Space is Not Your Enemy</a>, and ideally supplementing that with a more UX focused resource like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2uvUrR7">Don’t Make Me Think</a>. The practical side of HTML/CSS is easiest to pick up with experience. If you’re using devtools you can see what other people are doing with CSS and tweak and explore using the elements panel. And there are lots of good online resources for learning about CSS and HTML syntax like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> for API info or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> for ideas, tutorials and keeping up with new stuff.</p>
<h4 id="6-You-should-have-a-basic-understanding-of-networking-and-HTTP-based-APIs"><a href="#6-You-should-have-a-basic-understanding-of-networking-and-HTTP-based-APIs" class="headerlink" title="6. You should have a basic understanding of networking and HTTP-based APIs"></a>6. You should have a basic understanding of networking and HTTP-based APIs</h4><p>Because we’re assuming that this job involves using JavaScript in a browser or other client context, you should be able to understand the basics of networking. You should know what a client and server is. You should be able to explain a rough approximation of what happens when somebody enters a URL into the browser<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/#fn-4">4</a>. There’s a bunch of vocabulary thats good to know here. You should know what an HTTP request is and ideally know the conventions of what GET/PUT/POST/DELETE imply. It will help you to have a working definition of what REST is and what AJAX is. It’s good to get experience working with some HTTP based APIs, either at work or playing around with an API like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github</a>. You should also get familiar with at least one way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript (XMLHttpRequest, fetch, jQuery’s ajax methods).</p>
<h4 id="7-You-should-be-comfortable-with-Node-js-based-tooling"><a href="#7-You-should-be-comfortable-with-Node-js-based-tooling" class="headerlink" title="7. You should be comfortable with Node.js based tooling"></a>7. You should be comfortable with Node.js based tooling</h4><p>One of the biggest shifts in the last 5 years in the JavaScript world has been the explosive growth and consolidation of tools to help build JavaScript applications. Tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://eslint.org/">eslint</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> are essential to many teams workflows. While you don’t necessarily have to be experienced writing applications for Node.js, it is important that you be able to use those tools. That means knowing how to install Node and use npm to install and update packages. It also means getting comfortable with build tools like Webpack, Rollup or Ember CLI and knowing how to use them. Reasonable people can differ on how many tools and libraries you should be using, or what the right ones to use are, but having a basic familiarity with how the Node ecosystem works has become essential.</p>
<h4 id="8-You-should-know-how-to-use-a-framework-to-structure-a-moderately-sized-program"><a href="#8-You-should-know-how-to-use-a-framework-to-structure-a-moderately-sized-program" class="headerlink" title="8. You should know how to use a framework to structure a moderately sized program"></a>8. You should know how to use a framework to structure a moderately sized program</h4><p>A critical requirement for a developer who is expected to complete work with minimum supervision or hand-holding is the ability to structure their code in a maintainable way. That means having an understanding of (or helping define) the overall architecture of the system, and then writing code that fits into it. It also means being able to identify and help solve situations where the current architecture or code base norms causes problems. I put this in terms of frameworks because pretty much all medium to large JavaScript programs are using some sort of framework, whether it is an “official” framework like React, Angular, and Ember or a collection of helper files and functions cobbled together by a development team over time. For learning purposes, the popular official frameworks will usually be better to learn, since the knowledge can translate elsewhere, the purposes behind the structure are documented on the internet, and at least some sense of best practice architecture should be embedded in the code. To check this box I think it would be best to get experience with at least 2 frameworks/architectures, since it is difficult to tell which decisions a Framework makes are specific to its architecture and constraints without something to compare it with.</p>
<p>This is probably the most controversial item on this list, since I know a lot of folks believe it’s better to learn architecture ideas outside the constraints of a framework. My stance here is that frameworks are practical: they’re most likely to translate to an actual employment background and it’s easy to find practical explanations of how they solve architecture problems.</p>
<h4 id="9-You-should-know-the-basics-of-JavaScript-program-performance"><a href="#9-You-should-know-the-basics-of-JavaScript-program-performance" class="headerlink" title="9. You should know the basics of JavaScript program performance"></a>9. You should know the basics of JavaScript program performance</h4><p>Like design, performance is a deep well of things you can learn. But knowing the basics is important and can go a long ways. For performance “the basics” is more about process than knowledge. You need to learn how to debug slow processes and understand where the problems are coming from. For browser environments in particular there are some baseline things to understand. You’ll want to be able to tell the difference between code that is running slowly due to parsing slowness, runtime slowness, and network latency. It’s important to learn how to keep a UI responsive and not block rendering with other calculations. And it’s great to understand how to cache data and avoid making too many requests to the server.</p>
<p>This is also an area where learning more about Computer Science theory can be beneficial. Studying data structures and algorithms can help give you good intuitions on how to handle data, and learning about Big O notation gives you a language for discussing performance tradeoffs. This is the type of background knowledge that pays off in occasional subtle ways though, not something that is always obvious applicable in the moment.</p>
<h4 id="10-You-should-have-a-process-for-learning-new-things"><a href="#10-You-should-have-a-process-for-learning-new-things" class="headerlink" title="10. You should have a process for learning new things"></a>10. You should have a process for learning new things</h4><p>JavaScript development has changed a lot over the last 10 years, and there’s no reason to think it won’t continue to evolve over the next 10. There are also a lot of different technologies that fall under the umbrella of JavaScript, more than any one person can keep in their head. So it’s important to be able to keep up with the new technologies as they come along, and also learn about new technologies quickly when you need them. Ideally this means having at least one place where you can follow news about new JavaScript innovation. Could be Twitter, a set of blogs, newsletters or an aggregator site like Reddit or Hacker News. If you’re looking for an easy place to start, I’d recommend the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>You also need to get comfortable finding information about specific technologies, either to learn to use them or troubleshoot problems. These resources will likely be more varied, but it’s important to learn to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://xkcd.com/627/">Google well</a>, and also helpful to get familiar with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> or some other resource for getting help when you have specific questions or problems.</p>

It’s something that took me the longest time to realise, and which has helped me the most on my developer journey. If you only take away 1 thing from this article, let it be this.</p>
<p>When you are new to the world of code, it makes sense to tread in the footsteps of others. At the time of writing, a quick “learning how to code” Google search brings up more than <em>10.6 billion</em> results! It’s safe to say that coding is gaining popularity and there are tons of platforms and resources, but with that also come millions of opinions on how to get started. Before you buy a handful of recommended books and courses, first answer this: <strong>What is the most effective way for you to learn new concepts?</strong></p>
<p>Do you prefer to learn through books or documentation? Video tutorials? Interactive tutorials? Or perhaps you prefer to immediately get your hands dirty by building small projects and to solve problems as you go.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure about which way is best for you, feel free to experiment with this and to try out different methods. <strong>Learning a new topic on your own offers the luxury of being able to fully personalise and customise your journey and curriculum — use this to your advantage and find something that works for you!</strong></p>
<h3 id="Don’t-be-afraid-to-drop-popular-resources"><a href="#Don’t-be-afraid-to-drop-popular-resources" class="headerlink" title="Don’t be afraid to drop (popular) resources"></a>Don’t be afraid to drop (popular) resources</h3><p>If you’re like me and don’t like to leave things unfinished, this can be a hard thing to do. I lost count of how many resources (books, online courses, etc.) I tried just because they were heavily recommended. Ultimately, I only ended up sticking with a handful of resources because many others did not suit my skill level (or preferred way of learning), or because the explanation was insufficient for me.</p>
<p>Are you not enjoying or learning much from a course that seems to be loved by everyone else? Don’t get discouraged or doubt your competence, or get stuck on a resource that you dislike. <strong>Drop it or save it for later if you feel like it’s only introducing more questions rather than answering them. There are always plenty of alternatives!</strong></p>
<h3 id="Slow-down-and-start-with-the-basics"><a href="#Slow-down-and-start-with-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Slow down and start with the basics"></a>Slow down and start with the basics</h3><p>It’s no secret that the tech industry moves <em>fast</em>. Blink twice and someone is suddenly mentioning a brand new framework, website generator or CMS; libraries and packages are continuously being released left and right.</p>
<p>This can be daunting and truth be told, it’s hard to keep up. If you’re self-studying, make sure you grasp the basics first. Don’t worry about not knowing React, and focus on understanding JavaScript first. There’s no need to look at Tailwind or Styled Components just yet—instead, prioritise becoming comfortable with writing CSS. Everything else will come in due time (spoiler alert: you don’t always need to work with the latest and greatest technologies!).</p>
<h3 id="Apply-your-growth-mindset-and-know-your-motivation"><a href="#Apply-your-growth-mindset-and-know-your-motivation" class="headerlink" title="Apply your growth mindset and know your motivation"></a>Apply your growth mindset and know your motivation</h3><p>Apply a growth mindset (“I can’t do this” vs. “I can’t do this <em>yet</em>”) and find the real reason(s) you want to learn how to code. What is it that you enjoy about it the most? What would you like to use your new skills for? Having your motivation clear will not only make learning more fun, but it will also make you more resilient in frustrating times when your code is not working as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Try not to compare yourself to other learners as everyone has their own timeline and techniques.</strong> Keep an eye on your goals, but don’t forget to look back sometimes and see how far you have already come. This may sound straightforward and obvious, but progress is not always immediately visible. Don’t be too harsh on yourself and enjoy the ride! Good luck!</p>

  <p>the creator of WordPress, spoke about JavaScript in his yearly keynote “The State of Word”. In it, he gave the WordPress community homework — to <strong>Learn JavaScript, Deeply</strong>. To go out and make 2016 the year that you finally take those steps into getting comfortable with JavaScript.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/KrZx4IY1IgU">https://youtu.be/KrZx4IY1IgU</a></p>
<p>To see Matt acknowledge this shift in the tech stack has me really excited and it confirms that JavaScript is exploding, and regardless of what you use to build your websites, JavaScript must be a major part of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take Every Opportunity to really beef up your JavaScript Chops — Mall Mullenweg, Creator of WordPress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, I know there are many developers in the WordPress community who have been just getting by stringing together themes, jQuery plugins and Stack Overflow answers. There are many developers who feel burned, who feel it’s too hard to learn or just something they can get by without. There will always be varying degrees of JavaScript involvement in your sites, but the one constant is that the types of sites and the interactive interfaces that you make with WordPress are happening more in the browser and are requiring some level of JavaScript knowledge to get going.</p>
<p>So — how do you learn JavaScript? My answer is always this: Build things, build things, build things!</p>
<p>And while this is a simple answer to give, and is one you will get from many experienced developers. It’s frustrating to hear, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You aren’t sure what you should build — either from lack of ideas, or that you aren’t 100% sure what you are capable of</li>
<li>You need at least some fundamentals before you can get started!</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer is still to find a project that you are excited about, and invested in and see it through to completion. Along the way you are going to need some resources that will help you out. I’m compiling a list of resources here. This will be a living list — if you have something that has helped you, or something you have created and would like it added, please leave a comment below and I’ll get it added to the site.</p>
<p>Go forth and learn JavaScript. Will it be hard? Yes! Is everyone else smarter than you and maybe JS just isn’t for you? No! JavaScript doesn’t have a learning curve, it’s more like learning mountains. It’s hard, but push through it with nothing but hustle and repetition and you’ll get it, trust me, I’ve seen this with hundreds of students at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hackeryou.com/">HackerYou</a>.</p>

  <p>TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.</p>
<p>For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, and <code>object</code>, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.</p>
<p>This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.</p>
<p>This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing on its type system.</p>
<h2 id="Types-by-Inference"><a href="#Types-by-Inference" class="headerlink" title="Types by Inference"></a>Types by Inference</h2><p>TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">let helloWorld &#x3D; &quot;Hello World&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F;  ^ &#x3D; let helloWorld: string</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. That’s how TypeScript knows that <code>helloWorld</code> is a <code>string</code> in the above example.</p>
<p>You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="Defining-Types"><a href="#Defining-Types" class="headerlink" title="Defining Types"></a>Defining Types</h2><p>You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. However, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming). To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.</p>
<p>For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes <code>name: string</code> and <code>id: number</code>, you can write:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const user &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: &quot;Hayes&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an <code>interface</code> declaration:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new <code>interface</code> by using syntax like <code>: TypeName</code> after a variable declaration:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: &quot;Hayes&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If you provide an object that doesn’t match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  username: &quot;Hayes&quot;,Type &#39;&#123; username: string; id: number; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Object literal may only specify known properties, and &#39;username&#39; does not exist in type &#39;User&#39;.Type &#39;&#123; username: string; id: number; &#125;&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  Object literal may only specify known properties, and &#39;username&#39; does not exist in type &#39;User&#39;.</span><br><span class="line">  id: 0,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an interface declaration with classes:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">class UserAccount &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">  id: number;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  constructor(name: string, id: number) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    this.name &#x3D; name;</span><br><span class="line">    this.id &#x3D; id;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">const user: User &#x3D; new UserAccount(&quot;Murphy&quot;, 1);Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function getAdminUser(): User &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  &#x2F;&#x2F;...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">function deleteUser(user: User) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  &#x2F;&#x2F; ...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>There are already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: <code>boolean</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>object</code>, and <code>undefined</code>, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as <code>any</code> (allow anything), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/unknown-and-never"><code>unknown</code></a> (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/unknown-and-never"><code>never</code></a> (it’s not possible that this type could happen), and <code>void</code> (a function which returns <code>undefined</code> or has no return value).</p>
<p>You’ll see that there are two syntaxes for building types: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?e=83#example/types-vs-interfaces">Interfaces and Types</a>. You should prefer <code>interface</code>. Use <code>type</code> when you need specific features.</p>
<h2 id="Composing-Types"><a href="#Composing-Types" class="headerlink" title="Composing Types"></a>Composing Types</h2><p>With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with Unions, and with Generics.</p>
<h3 id="Unions"><a href="#Unions" class="headerlink" title="Unions"></a>Unions</h3><p>With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. For example, you can describe a <code>boolean</code> type as being either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type MyBool &#x3D; true | false;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you hover over <code>MyBool</code> above, you’ll see that it is classed as <code>boolean</code>. That’s a property of the Structural Type System. More on this below.</p>
<p>A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of <code>string</code>s or <code>number</code>s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/literal-types.html">literal</a> that a value is allowed to be:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type WindowStates &#x3D; &quot;open&quot; | &quot;closed&quot; | &quot;minimized&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">type LockStates &#x3D; &quot;locked&quot; | &quot;unlocked&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">type OddNumbersUnderTen &#x3D; 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Unions provide a way to handle different types too. For example, you may have a function that takes an <code>array</code> or a <code>string</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function getLength(obj: string | string[]) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  return obj.length;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>To learn the type of a variable, use <code>typeof</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Type</th>
<th align="left">Predicate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">string</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof s === &quot;string&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">number</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof n === &quot;number&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">boolean</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof b === &quot;boolean&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">undefined</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof undefined === &quot;undefined&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">function</td>
<td align="left"><code>typeof f === &quot;function&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">array</td>
<td align="left"><code>Array.isArray(a)</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For example, you can make a function return different values depending on whether it is passed a string or an array:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function wrapInArray(obj: string | string[]) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  if (typeof obj &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;string&quot;) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return [obj];&#x2F;&#x2F;          ^ &#x3D; (parameter) obj: string</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  &#125; else &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return obj;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="Generics"><a href="#Generics" class="headerlink" title="Generics"></a>Generics</h3><p>Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.</p>

<h2 id="Structural-Type-System"><a href="#Structural-Type-System" class="headerlink" title="Structural Type System"></a>Structural Type System</h2><p>One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type checking focuses on the <em>shape</em> that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural typing”.</p>
<p>In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface Point &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  x: number;</span><br><span class="line">  y: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">function logPoint(p: Point) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  console.log(&#96;$&#123;p.x&#125;, $&#123;p.y&#125;&#96;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F; logs &quot;12, 26&quot;</span><br><span class="line">const point &#x3D; &#123; x: 12, y: 26 &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">logPoint(point);Try</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <code>point</code> variable is never declared to be a <code>Point</code> type. However, TypeScript compares the shape of <code>point</code> to the shape of <code>Point</code> in the type-check. They have the same shape, so the code passes.</p>
<p>The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object’s fields to match.</p>

<p>There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes:</p>

<p>If the object or class has all the required properties, TypeScript will say they match, regardless of the implementation details.</p>

  <p>Is React hard to learn? Is React easy to learn? Well, it depends on your approach.</p>
<p>This here is your timeline for learning React. Think of these steps as layers in a foundation.</p>
<p>If you were building a house, would you skip some steps to get it done faster? Maybe jump right to pouring the concrete before laying some rocks down? Start building the walls on bare earth?</p>
<p>Or how about making a wedding cake: the top part looks the most fun to decorate, so why not start there! Just figure out the bottom part later.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Of course not. You know those things would lead to failure.</p>
<p>So why does the standard approach to learning React involve trying to learn ES6 + Webpack + Babel + Redux + Routing + AJAX + React <em>all at once</em>? Sounds like a surefire path to overwhelm (and giving up)!</p>
<p>So I’ve laid out a timeline. Take these one step at a time. Do not skip steps. Do not learn 2 steps at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="So-How-Long-Does-it-Take-To-Learn-React"><a href="#So-How-Long-Does-it-Take-To-Learn-React" class="headerlink" title="So How Long Does it Take To Learn React?"></a>So How Long Does it Take To Learn React?</h2><p>The thing is, everyone starts from a different place. You’ll have a different set of knowledge coming in than I did, or than the people on Twitter do, or than your coworkers did. So it’s really hard to give specific timelines.</p>
<p>My own path was something like: programming as a kid, did programming in high school, got a CS degree with bachelors and masters, worked 4-5 years doing low-level C/C++ development, then worked 2 years with JS &amp; jQuery &amp; Java, then a year or so with AngularJS (1.x), and then learning the basics of React took a few days.</p>
<p>If your background is different, it’ll take you a different amount of time. If you’re starting to learn programming at the same time you’re learning React, it will take longer, and that’s fine. That’s normal and expected.</p>
<p>The theme of the strategy I’ll lay out below is to <strong>avoid getting overwhelmed</strong>. Slow and steady, uh, learns the React ;)</p>
<p>I’m a big believer in giving yourself tiny wins along the way. It makes the process more fun, and makes the learning go faster, too. So whichever step you’re on, try to break the project or exercise or tutorial into small pieces that you can complete to get yourself a little win. Celebrate it.</p>
<p>Always keep in mind that you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/your-own-react-project-ideas/">minimize or simplify</a> a problem from the stated one. Choose your own difficulty setting. And if you run out of ideas, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/learn-react-with-copywork/">copy stuff that exists</a>. It’s a great way to learn.</p>
<h2 id="Step-0-JavaScript"><a href="#Step-0-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Step 0: JavaScript"></a>Step 0: JavaScript</h2><p>Do you need to know JavaScript before you learn React? And how much JavaScript should you know?</p>
<p>Well, JS is Step 0 for a reason. It’ll be hard to learn React without knowing a decent amount of JavaScript, because a lot of React’s syntax is in fact regular JavaScript.</p>
<p>You’ll want to have a good handle on things like…</p>
<ul>
<li>how <code>this</code> works (particularly how the current scope affects the value of <code>this</code>)</li>
<li>function scope vs block scope</li>
<li>control structures like <code>if</code> and <code>switch</code></li>
<li>how to write and call functions</li>
<li>how to create and access objects and arrays</li>
<li>functional features, especially <code>Array.map</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s not an exhaustive list but I think if you can do those things, you can start playing with React in small experimental apps. I’d highly recommend against trying to build a complicated piece of software (like that SaaS app you’ve been dreaming of) as your first outing. Big apps are bad learning projects. Get a few tiny apps (e.g. a few hours, a day, a weekend) under your belt first.</p>
<p>With prior programming experience, JS probably won’t take you too long to pick up. It has some quirks – scoping of <code>this</code> is particularly quirky – but it’s a C-like language so if you’re used to one of those you should be all set.</p>
<p>Here is a good series of books called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don’t Know JS</a>. They’re free to read online.</p>
<p>The latest versions of React have phased out their usage of ES5 and the old <code>createClass</code> way of making components – it’s all ES6 classes now. But outside of those, there isn’t too much ES6-specific syntax that’s absolutely required. Learn it as you go.</p>
<h2 id="Step-0-5-NPM-or-Yarn"><a href="#Step-0-5-NPM-or-Yarn" class="headerlink" title="Step 0.5: NPM (or Yarn)"></a>Step 0.5: NPM (or Yarn)</h2><p>In order to use React and friends, you’ll need a package manager.</p>
<p>NPM and Yarn are the big two package managers of the JavaScript world. There isn’t too much to learn here. When you <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nodejs.org/">install Node.js</a> it comes bundled with NPM. Afer that, all you really need to know is how to install packages (<code>npm install &lt;package name&gt;</code>).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> is a more recent package manager and gives some nice improvements over NPM, chief of which is speed of installation. I use Yarn almost exclusively for that reason.</p>
<p>Every package is available through NPM or with Yarn – there are no exclusivity contracts here ;) So try both and pick your favorite.</p>
<h2 id="Step-1-React"><a href="#Step-1-React" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: React"></a>Step 1: React</h2><p>Start with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/test-drive-react/">Hello World</a>. Use either a plain HTML file with some <code>script</code> tags ala the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html">official tutorial</a> or use a tool like React Heatpack to get you up and running quickly.</p>
<p>Try out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/test-drive-react/">Hello World in 3 minutes</a> tutorial!</p>
<h2 id="Step-2-Build-a-Few-Things-and-Throw-Them-Away"><a href="#Step-2-Build-a-Few-Things-and-Throw-Them-Away" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Build a Few Things, and Throw Them Away"></a>Step 2: Build a Few Things, and Throw Them Away</h2><p>This is the awkward middle step that a lot of people skip.</p>
<p>Don’t make that mistake. Moving forward without having a firm grasp of React’s concepts will lead straight back to overwhelmsville.</p>
<p>But this step isn’t very well-defined: what should you build? A prototype for work? Maybe a fancy Facebook clone, something meaty to really get used to the whole stack?</p>
<p>Well, no, not those things. They’re either loaded with baggage or too large for a learning project.</p>
<p>“Prototypes” for work are especially terrible, because <em>you absolutely know</em> in your heart that a “prototype” will be nothing of the sort. It will live long beyond the prototype phase, morph into shipping software, and never be thrown away or rewritten.</p>
<p>Using a work “prototype” as a learning project is problematic because you’re likely to get all worked up about the <em>future</em>. Because you <em>know</em> it’ll be more than just a prototype, you start to worry – shouldn’t it have tests? I should make sure the architecture will scale… Am I going to have to refactor this mess later? And shouldn’t it have tests?</p>
<p>This specific problem is what I cover in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/pure-react/?_r=timeline">Pure React</a>: once you get past “Hello World,” how do you learn to “think in React?”</p>
<p>Here’s the gist: the ideal projects are somewhere between “Hello World” and “All of Twitter.”</p>
<p>Build some lists of things (TODOs, beers, movies). Learn how the data flow works. For some ideas try this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/">list of React practice projects</a> or if you’re into music try <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/build-metronome-react/">building a little metronome</a>.</p>
<p>Take some existing large UIs (Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, etc) and break off a small chunk to build – carve it up into components, build the pieces, and render it with static data. “Copywork” is the practice of recreating existing apps as a way of improving your skills and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/learn-react-with-copywork/">copywork is a great way to learn React</a>.</p>
<p>You get the idea: small, throwaway apps. They <em>must be throwaways</em> otherwise you’ll get hung up on maintainability and architecture and other crap that just doesn’t matter yet.</p>
<p>I wrote <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/pure-react/?_r=timeline">Pure React</a> to teach this way because there’s not much else out there that takes the bite-size approach.</p>
<h3 id="React-is-Hard"><a href="#React-is-Hard" class="headerlink" title="React is Hard"></a>React is Hard</h3><p>Before you go too much further I just want to be straight with you. Learning React is gonna be tough. You will struggle at first, and that is <em>TOTALLY NORMAL</em>. The only way out is through: keep building tiny things until the concepts sink in.</p>
<p>Practice is super important. <em>Building apps</em>, even (especially) tiny ones is super important. Don’t just read tutorials and watch videos. Learning React (or anything, really) is not a linear process. It does not go like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>read/watch tutorials until it makes sense</li>
<li>build a great app</li>
</ol>
<p>The fastest path is (counterintuitively) more like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>read/watch just <em>one</em> tutorial</li>
<li>try out what you just learned</li>
<li>make some mistakes, re-read, fix them, try again</li>
<li>try it on your own again</li>
<li>success! tiny win! back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>So keep that in mind as you’re working through this stuff. It’s hard. It will get easier, but it will suck for a while, and you’re not stupid or foolish for struggling. Everybody struggles! “Programming is suffering.” At least I think that was the quote.</p>
<h2 id="Step-3-Webpack"><a href="#Step-3-Webpack" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Webpack"></a>Step 3: Webpack</h2><p>Build tools are a major stumbling block. Setting up Webpack feels like stumbling through a dark cave the first few times, and it’s a whole different mindset from writing UI code. This is why Webpack is down at Step 3, instead of Step 0.</p>
<p>I recommend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/webpack-the-confusing-parts-58712f8fcad9">Webpack – The Confusing Parts</a> as an introduction to Webpack and its way of thinking.</p>
<p>Once you understand what it does (bundles <em>every kind of file</em>, not just JS) – and how it works (loaders for each file type), the Webpack part of your life will be much happier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can just avoid it by sticking with Create React App. It’s an awesome tool for development, and it’s even well-suited to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://daveceddia.com/deploy-create-react-app-surge/">build and deploy your React app to production</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Step-4-ES6"><a href="#Step-4-ES6" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: ES6"></a>Step 4: ES6</h2><p>Now that you’re in Step 4, you have all those steps above as <em>context</em>. The bits of ES6 you learn now will help you write cleaner, better code – and faster. If you tried to memorize it all in the beginning, it wouldn’t have stuck – but now, you know how it all fits in.</p>
<p>Learn the parts you’ll use most: arrow functions, let/const, classes, destructuring, and <code>import</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Step-5-Routing"><a href="#Step-5-Routing" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Routing"></a>Step 5: Routing</h2><p>Some people conflate React Router and Redux in their head – they’re not related or dependent on each other. You can (and should!) learn to use React Router before diving into Redux.</p>
<p>By this point you’ll have a solid foundation in “thinking in React,” and React Router’s component-based approach will make more sense than if you’d tackled it on Day 1.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6-Redux"><a href="#Step-6-Redux" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Redux"></a>Step 6: Redux</h2><p>Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-makes-you-sad">will tell you</a> not to add Redux too early, and for good reason – it’s a dose of complexity that can be disastrous early on.</p>
<p>The concepts behind Redux are simple in isolation. But there is a mental leap from understanding the pieces to knowing how to use them in an app.</p>
<p>So, repeat what you did in Step 2: build disposable apps. Build a bunch of little Redux experiements to really internalize how it works.</p>
<h2 id="Non-steps"><a href="#Non-steps" class="headerlink" title="Non-steps"></a>Non-steps</h2><p>There are a few bits of “common wisdom” that will torpedo your progress pretty quickly. Boilerplate projects, for one.</p>
<p>Diving into React by picking one of the bajillion boilerplate projects out there will only confuse you. They include every possible library, and force a directory structure upon you – and neither of these are required for smaller apps, or when you’re getting started.</p>
<p>It <em>seems</em> logical to start with a solid foundation in the form of a boilerplate that enforces best practices – but it’s a ton of complexity right up front that will make React &amp; the related libraries harder to learn than if you tackled them one-by-one.</p>
<p>And if you’re thinking “But Dave I’m not building a small app, I’m building a complex app that will serve millions of users!”… go re-read that bit about prototypes ;)</p>
<h2 id="How-to-tackle-this"><a href="#How-to-tackle-this" class="headerlink" title="How to tackle this"></a>How to tackle this</h2><p>This is a lot to take in. It’s a lot to learn – but there’s a logical progression. One foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>Remember: it’ll be tough at first. Everybody struggles with this. Frontend development is complicated. But you can work through it! Tiny apps. Tiny wins. Lots of practice. It will all add up to understanding the entire stack and being able to build whatever you can imagine.</p>

  <p>Hey, I got this new web project, but to be honest I haven’t coded much web in a few years and I’ve heard the landscape changed a bit. You are the most up-to date web dev around here right?</p>
<p><em>-The actual term is Front End engineer, but yeah, I’m the right guy. I do web in 2016. Visualisations, music players, flying drones that play football, you name it. I just came back from JsConf and ReactConf, so I know the latest technologies to create web apps.</em></p>
<p>Cool. I need to create a page that displays the latest activity from the users, so I just need to get the data from the REST endpoint and display it in some sort of filterable table, and update it if anything changes in the server. I was thinking maybe using jQuery to fetch and display the data?</p>
<p><em>-Oh my god no, no one uses jQuery anymore. You should try learning React, it’s 2016.</em></p>
<p>Oh, OK. What’s React?</p>
<p><em>-It’s a super cool library made by some guys at Facebook, it really brings control and performance to your application, by allowing you to handle any view changes very easily.</em></p>
<p>That sounds neat. Can I use React to display data from the server?</p>
<p><em>-Yeah, but first you need to add React and React DOM as a library in your webpage.</em></p>
<p>Wait, why two libraries?</p>
<p><em>-So one is the actual library and the second one is for manipulating the DOM, which now you can describe in JSX.</em></p>
<p>JSX? What is JSX?</p>
<p><em>-JSX is just a JavaScript syntax extension that looks pretty much like XML. It’s kind of another way to describe the DOM, think of it as a better HTML.</em></p>
<p>What’s wrong with HTML?</p>
<p><em>-It’s 2016. No one codes HTML directly anymore.</em></p>
<p>Right. Anyway, if I add these two libraries then I can use React?</p>
<p><em>-Not quite. You need to add Babel, and then you are able to use React.</em></p>
<p>Another library? What’s Babel?</p>
<p><em>-Oh, Babel is a transpiler that allows you to target specific versions of JavaScript, while you code in any version of JavaScript. You don’t HAVE to include Babel to use ReactJS, but unless you do, you are stuck with using ES5, and let’s be real, it’s 2016, you should be coding in ES2016+ like the rest of the cool kids do.</em></p>
<p>ES5? ES2016+? I’m getting lost over here. What’s ES5 and ES2016+?</p>
<p><em>-ES5 stands for ECMAScript 5. It’s the edition that has most people target since it has been implemented by most browsers nowadays.</em></p>
<p>ECMAScript?</p>
<p><em>-Yes, you know, the scripting standard JavaScript was based on in 1999 after its initial release in 1995, back then when JavaScript was named Livescript and only ran in the Netscape Navigator. That was very messy back then, but thankfully now things are very clear and we have, like, 7 editions of this implementation.</em></p>
<p>7 editions. For real. And ES5 and ES2016+ are?</p>
<p><em>-The fifth and seventh edition respectively.</em></p>
<p>Wait, what happened with the sixth?</p>
<p><em>-You mean ES6? Yeah, I mean, each edition is a superset of the previous one, so if you are using ES2016+, you are using all the features of the previous versions.</em></p>
<p>Right. And why use ES2016+ over ES6 then?</p>
<p><em>-Well, you COULD use ES6, but to use cool features like async and await, you need to use ES2016+. Otherwise you are stuck with ES6 generators with coroutines to block asynchronous calls for proper control flow.</em></p>
<p>I have no idea what you just said, and all these names are confusing. Look, I’m just loading a bunch of data from a server, I used to be able to just include jQuery from a CDN and just get the data with AJAX calls, why can’t I just do that?</p>
<p><em>-It’s 2016 man, no one uses jQuery anymore, it ends up in a bunch of spaghetti code. Everyone knows that.</em></p>
<p>Right. So my alternative is to load three libraries to fetch data and display a HTML table.</p>
<p><em>-Well, you include those three libraries but bundle them up with a module manager to load only one file.</em></p>
<p>I see. And what’s a module manager?</p>
<p><em>-The definition depends on the environment, but in the web we usually mean anything that supports AMD or CommonJS modules.</em></p>
<p>Riiight. And AMD and CommonJS are…?</p>
<p><em>-Definitions. There are ways to describe how multiple JavaScript libraries and classes should interact. You know, exports and requires? You can write multiple JavaScript files defining the AMD or CommonJS API and you can use something like Browserify to bundle them up.</em></p>
<p>OK, that makes sense… I think. What is Browserify?</p>
<p><em>-It’s a tool that allows you to bundle CommonJS described dependencies to files that can be run in the browser. It was created because most people publish those dependencies in the npm registry.</em></p>
<p>npm registry?</p>
<p><em>-It’s a very big public repository where smart people put code and dependencies as modules.</em></p>
<p>Like a CDN?</p>
<p><em>-Not really. It’s more like a centralised database where anyone can publish and download libraries, so you can use them locally for development and then upload them to a CDN if you want to.</em></p>
<p>Oh, like Bower!</p>
<p><em>-Yes, but it’s 2016 now, no one uses Bower anymore.</em></p>
<p>Oh, I see… so I need to download the libraries from npm then?</p>
<p><em>-Yes. So for instance, if you want to use React , you download the React module and import it in your code. You can do that for almost every popular JavaScript library.</em></p>
<p>Oh, like Angular!</p>
<p><em>-Angular is so 2015. But yes. Angular would be there, alongside VueJS or RxJS and other cool 2016 libraries. Want to learn about those?</em></p>
<p>Let’s stick with React, I’m already learning too many things now. So, if I need to use React I fetch it from this npm and then use this Browserify thing?</p>
<p><em>-Yes.</em></p>
<p>That seems overly complicated to just grab a bunch of dependencies and tie them together.</p>
<p><em>-It is, that’s why you use a task manager like Grunt or Gulp or Broccoli to automate running Browserify. Heck, you can even use Mimosa.</em></p>
<p>Grunt? Gulp? Broccoli? Mimosa? The heck are we talking about now?</p>
<p><em>-Task managers. But they are not cool anymore. We used them in like, 2015, then we used Makefiles, but now we wrap everything with Webpack.</em></p>
<p>Makefiles? I thought that was mostly used on C or C++ projects.</p>
<p><em>-Yeah, but apparently in the web we love making things complicated and then going back to the basics. We do that every year or so, just wait for it, we are going to do assembly in the web in a year or two.</em></p>
<p>Sigh. You mentioned something called Webpack?</p>
<p><em>-It’s another module manager for the browser while being kind of a task runner as well. It’s like a better version of Browserify.</em></p>
<p>Oh, Ok. Why is it better?</p>
<p><em>-Well, maybe not better, it’s just more opinionated on how your dependencies should be tied. Webpack allows you to use different module managers, and not only CommonJS ones, so for instance native ES6 supported modules.</em></p>
<p>I’m extremely confused by this whole CommonJS/ES6 thing.</p>
<p><em>-Everyone is, but you shouldn’t care anymore with SystemJS.</em></p>
<p>Jesus christ, another noun-js. Ok, and what is this SystemJS?</p>
<p><em>-Well, unlike Browserify and Webpack 1.x, SystemJS is a dynamic module loader that allows you to tie multiple modules in multiple files instead of bundling them in one big file.</em></p>
<p>Wait, but I thought we wanted to build our libraries in one big file and load that!</p>
<p><em>-Yes, but because HTTP/2 is coming now multiple HTTP requests are actually better.</em></p>
<p>Wait, so can’t we just add the three original libraries for React??</p>
<p><em>-Not really. I mean, you could add them as external scripts from a CDN, but you would still need to include Babel then.</em></p>
<p>Sigh. And that is bad right?</p>
<p><em>-Yes, you would be including the entire babel-core, and it wouldn’t be efficient for production. On production you need to perform a series of pre-tasks to get your project ready that make the ritual to summon Satan look like a boiled eggs recipe. You need to minify assets, uglify them, inline css above the fold, defer scripts, as well as-</em></p>
<p>I got it, I got it. So if you wouldn’t include the libraries directly in a CDN, how would you do it?</p>
<p><em>-I would transpile it from Typescript using a Webpack + SystemJS + Babel combo.</em></p>
<p>Typescript? I thought we were coding in JavaScript!</p>
<p><em>-Typescript IS JavaScript, or better put, a superset of JavaScript, more specifically JavaScript on version ES6. You know, that sixth version we talked about before?</em></p>
<p>I thought ES2016+ was already a superset of ES6! WHY we need now this thing called Typescript?</p>
<p><em>-Oh, because it allows us to use JavaScript as a typed language, and reduce run-time errors. It’s 2016, you should be adding some types to your JavaScript code.</em></p>
<p>And Typescript obviously does that.</p>
<p><em>-Flow as well, although it only checks for typing while Typescript is a superset of JavaScript which needs to be compiled.</em></p>
<p>Sigh… and Flow is?</p>
<p><em>-It’s a static type checker made by some guys at Facebook. They coded it in OCaml, because functional</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming"><em>programming</em></a> <em>is awesome.</em></p>
<p>OCaml? Functional programming?</p>
<p><em>-It’s what the cool kids use nowadays man, you know, 2016? Functional programming? High order functions? Currying? Pure functions?</em></p>
<p>I have no idea what you just said.</p>
<p><em>-No one does at the beginning. Look, you just need to know that functional programming is better than OOP and that’s what we should be using in 2016.</em></p>
<p>Wait, I learned OOP in college, I thought that was good?</p>
<p><em>-So was Java before being bought by Oracle. I mean, OOP was good back in the days, and it still has its uses today, but now everyone is realising modifying states is equivalent to kicking babies, so now everyone is moving to immutable objects and functional programming. Haskell guys had been calling it for years, -and don’t get me started with the Elm guys- but luckily in the web now we have libraries like Ramda that allow us to use functional programming in plain JavaScript.</em></p>
<p>Are you just dropping names for the sake of it? What the hell is Ramnda?</p>
<p><em>-No. Ramda. Like Lambda. You know, that David Chambers’ library?</em></p>
<p>David who?</p>
<p><em>-David Chambers. Cool guy. Plays a mean Coup game. One of the contributors for Ramda. You should also check Erik Meijer if you are serious about learning functional programming.</em></p>
<p>And Erik Meijer is…?</p>
<p><em>-Functional programming guy as well. Awesome guy. He has a bunch of presentations where he trashes Agile while using this weird coloured shirt. You should also check some of the stuff from Tj, Jash Kenas, Sindre Sorhus, Paul Irish, Addy Osmani-</em></p>
<p>Ok. I’m going to stop you there. All that is good and fine, but I think all that is just so complicated and unnecessary for just fetching data and displaying it. I’m pretty sure I don’t need to know these people or learn all those things to create a table with dynamic data. Let’s get back to React. How can I fetch the data from the server with React?</p>
<p><em>-Well, you actually don’t fetch the data with React, you just display the data with React.</em></p>
<p>Oh, damn me. So what do you use to fetch the data?</p>
<p><em>-You use Fetch to fetch the data from the server.</em></p>
<p>I’m sorry? You use Fetch to fetch the data? Whoever is naming those things needs a thesaurus.</p>
<p><em>-I know right? Fetch it’s the name of the native implementation for performing XMLHttpRequests against a server.</em></p>
<p>Oh, so AJAX.</p>
<p><em>-AJAX is just the use of XMLHttpRequests. But sure. Fetch allows you to do AJAX based in promises, which then you can resolve to avoid the callback hell.</em></p>
<p>Callback hell?</p>
<p><em>-Yeah. Every time you perform an asynchronous request against the server, you need to wait for its response, which then makes you to add a function within a function, which is called the callback pyramid from hell.</em></p>
<p>Oh, Ok. And this promise thing solves it?</p>
<p><em>-Indeed. By manipulating your callbacks through promises, you can write easier to understand code, mock and test them, as well as perform simultaneous requests at once and wait until all of them are loaded.</em></p>
<p>And that can be done with Fetch?</p>
<p><em>-Yes, but only if your user uses an evergreen browser, otherwise you need to include a Fetch polyfill or use Request, Bluebird or Axios.</em></p>
<p>How many libraries do I need to know for god’s sake? How many are of them?</p>
<p><em>-It’s JavaScript. There has to be thousands of libraries that all do the same thing. We know libraries, in fact, we have the best libraries. Our libraries are huuuge, and sometimes we include pictures of Guy Fieri in them.</em></p>
<p>Did you just say Guy Fieri? Let’s get this over with. What these Bluebird, Request, Axios libraries do?</p>
<p><em>-They are libraries to perform XMLHttpRequests that return promises.</em></p>
<p>Didn’t jQuery’s AJAX method start to return promises as well?</p>
<p><em>-We don’t use the “J” word in 2016 anymore. Just use Fetch, and polyfill it when it’s not in a browser or use Bluebird, Request or Axios instead. Then manage the promise with await within an async function and boom, you have proper control flow.</em></p>
<p>It’s the third time you mention await but I have no idea what it is.</p>
<p><em>-Await allows you to block an asynchronous call, allowing you to have better control on when the data is being fetch and overall increasing code readability. It’s awesome, you just need to make sure you add the stage-3 preset in Babel, or use syntax-async-functions and transform-async-to-generator plugin.</em></p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p><em>-No, insane is the fact you need to precompile Typescript code and then transpile it with Babel to use await.</em></p>
<p>Wat? It’s not included in Typescript?</p>
<p><em>-It does in the next version, but as of version 1.7 it only targets ES6, so if you want to use await in the browser, first you need to compile your Typescript code targeting ES6 and then Babel that shit up to target ES5.</em></p>
<p>At this point I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><em>-Look, it’s easy. Code everything in Typescript. All modules that use Fetch compile them to target ES6, transpile them with Babel on a stage-3 preset, and load them with SystemJS. If you don’t have Fetch, polyfill it, or use Bluebird, Request or Axios, and handle all your promises with await.</em></p>
<p>We have very different definitions of easy. So, with that ritual I finally fetched the data and now I can display it with React right?</p>
<p><em>-Is your application going to handle any state changes?</em></p>
<p>Err, I don’t think so. I just need to display the data.</p>
<p><em>-Oh, thank god. Otherwise I would had to explain you Flux, and implementations like Flummox, Alt, Fluxible. Although to be honest you should be using Redux.</em></p>
<p>I’m going to just fly over those names. Again, I just need to display data.</p>
<p><em>-Oh, if you are just displaying the data you didn’t need React to begin with. You would had been fine with a templating engine.</em></p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Do you think this is funny? Is that how you treat your loved ones?</p>
<p><em>-I was just explaining what you could use.</em></p>
<p>Stop. Just stop.</p>
<p><em>-I mean, even if it’s just using templating engine, I would still use a Typescript + SystemJS + Babel combo if I were you.</em></p>
<p>I need to display data on a page, not perform Sub Zero’s original MK fatality. Just tell me what templating engine to use and I’ll take it from there.</p>
<p><em>-There’s a lot, which one you are familiar with?</em></p>
<p>Ugh, can’t remember the name. It was a long time ago.</p>
<p><em>-jTemplates? jQote? PURE?</em></p>
<p>Err, doesn’t ring a bell. Another one?</p>
<p><em>-Transparency? JSRender? MarkupJS? KnockoutJS? That one had two-way binding.</em></p>
<p>Another one?</p>
<p><em>-PlatesJS? jQuery-tmpl? Handlebars? Some people still use it.</em></p>
<p>Maybe. Are there similar to that last one?</p>
<p><em>-Mustache, underscore? I think now even lodash has one to be honest, but those are kind of 2014.</em></p>
<p>Err.. maybe it was newer.</p>
<p><em>-Jade? DustJS?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>-DotJS? EJS?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>-Nunjucks? ECT?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>-Mah, no one likes Coffeescript syntax anyway. Jade?</em></p>
<p>No, you already said Jade.</p>
<p><em>-I meant Pug. I meant Jade. I mean, Jade is now Pug.</em></p>
<p>Sigh. No. Can’t remember. Which one would you use?</p>
<p><em>-Probably just ES6 native template strings.</em></p>
<p>Let me guess. And that requires ES6.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, depending on what browser I’m using needs Babel.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, if I want to include without adding the entire core library, I need to load it as a module from npm.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, requires Browserify, or Wepback, or most likely that other thing called SystemJS.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>Which, unless it’s Webpack, ideally should be managed by a task runner.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>But, since I should be using functional programming and typed languages I first need to pre-compile Typescript or add this Flow thingy.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>And then send that to Babel if I want to use await.</p>
<p><em>-Correct.</em></p>
<p>So I can then use Fetch, promises, and control flow and all that magic.</p>
<p><em>-Just don’t forget to polyfill Fetch if it’s not supported, Safari still can’t handle it.</em></p>
<p>You know what. I think we are done here. Actually, I think I’m done. I’m done with the web, I’m done with JavaScript altogether.</p>
<p><em>-That’s fine, in a few years we all are going to be coding in Elm or WebAssembly.</em></p>
<p>I’m just going to move back to the backend. I just can’t handle these many changes and versions and editions and compilers and transpilers. The JavaScript community is insane if it thinks anyone can keep up with this.</p>
<p><em>-I hear you. You should try the Python community then.</em></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><em>-Ever heard of Python 3?</em></p>
