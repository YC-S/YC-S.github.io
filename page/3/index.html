  <p>New Jersey, constituent state of the United States of America. One of the original 13 states, it is bounded by New York to the north and northeast, the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south, and Delaware and Pennsylvania to the west. The state was named for the island of Jersey in the English Channel. The capital is Trenton.</p>
<p>Although it has major social, economic, and political force in its own right, New Jersey is sometimes looked upon as a stepchild among the heavily industrialized and populated states along the Eastern Seaboard. New Jersey is one of the smallest states in area, but it is highly urbanized and has one of the country’s highest population densities. Hundreds of thousands of its citizens commute to New York and Pennsylvania. New Jersey’s transportation system is one of the busiest and most extensive in the world, and it weaves the state into the fabric of the region by funneling goods and people to New York City and other points north and to Philadelphia and points south. For hundreds of thousands of visitors it offers long stretches of fine beaches along the Atlantic Ocean, and the resort town of Atlantic City may be better known than the state itself.</p>
<p>Above all, New Jersey is rife with contradiction and anomaly. Its people fiercely fight off attempts of state government to end home rule by powerful municipal administrations. While the state has produced some of the most able and respected U.S. governors, corruption has often played a part in its local politics, and it has achieved notoriety as a major locus of organized crime.</p>
<p>New Jersey is called the Garden State because it became famous in the 18th century for the fertility of its land. It is now also among the most urbanized and crowded of states. The urban density of its northeast contrasts sharply, however, with the rugged hills of the northwest, the enormous stretches of pine forest in the southeast (the Pine Barrens), and the rolling and lush horse country in the south-central part of the state. New Jersey is an important industrial centre, but it has paid the price in environmental pollution, in dirt and noise, and in congested roads and slums. In sum, New Jersey is a curious amalgam of urban and rural, poor and wealthy, progressive and conservative, parochial and cosmopolitan. Indeed, it is one of the most diverse states in the union. Area 8,723 square miles (22,591 square km). Population (2010) 8,791,894; (2019 est.) 8,882,190.</p>
<h2 id="Land"><a href="#Land" class="headerlink" title="Land"></a>Land</h2><h3 id="Relief"><a href="#Relief" class="headerlink" title="Relief"></a>Relief</h3><p>New Jersey comprises four distinct physical regions: the Ridge and Valley section of the northwest, where the folded Appalachian Mountains slice across the state; the Highlands, a southern extension of the ancient rocks of New England, which also trend across the state in a northeast-southwest direction; the rolling central Piedmont, where many of the major cities and suburbs are located; and the relatively level Atlantic Coastal Plain, which is divided into an inner and an outer portion. The state’s highest elevation is High Point, at 1,803 feet (550 metres), located just south of the New York border in Sussex county.</p>
<p>The Outer Coastal Plain, with its relatively poor sandy soils, is where the Pine Barrens are located. The best soils are located on the Inner Coastal Plain and on the Piedmont and in valleys in the New England section south of the last glacial advance. Although suburbanization has devoured much of New Jersey’s agricultural land, substantial estates and farms still exist in parts of the Piedmont, and truck farms still dominate many parts of the southern Inner Coastal Plain. The northern Inner Coastal Plain is home to prosperous horse farms, and some dairying still exists in the Ridge and Valley section. The most striking features of the state are its beaches, the Pine Barrens, The Palisades facing Manhattan, the broad marshes and swampland in the northeast, and the hills of the northwest, including the famous Delaware Water Gap.</p>
<h3 id="Drainage"><a href="#Drainage" class="headerlink" title="Drainage"></a>Drainage</h3><p>Lakes and ponds cover about 300 square miles (780 square km) of the state’s surface. New Jersey’s major river, which it shares with Pennsylvania, is the Delaware. The Hudson River separates the state from New York. Other major rivers are the Passaic and the Hackensack, both in the northeast, and the Raritan, which runs west to east and is generally regarded as the boundary between North and Central Jersey. Lake Hopatcong, in Sussex and Morris counties, is the state’s largest lake.</p>
<h3 id="Climate"><a href="#Climate" class="headerlink" title="Climate"></a>Climate</h3><p>The northwest experiences relatively cold winters, with average January temperatures below 28 °F (−2 °C). Relatively mild conditions prevail in the south, with average winter temperatures above freezing. Summers are relatively hot throughout the state, with averages for July ranging from about 70 °F (21 °C) in the northwest to above 76 °F (24 °C) in the southwest. Moist conditions prevail, with seasonally well-distributed precipitation averaging from 44 inches to more than 52 inches (1,120 to 1,320 mm).</p>
<h3 id="Plant-and-animal-life"><a href="#Plant-and-animal-life" class="headerlink" title="Plant and animal life"></a>Plant and animal life</h3><p>Virtually all of the plant life that is common to the northeastern United States can be found in New Jersey, and many rare plant species grow in the marshes and Pine Barrens, including some insect-ingesting plants. The Barrens are dominated, however, by oak and pine on the well-drained sites and by white cedar in the poorly drained bogs. Common trees elsewhere include oaks, sugar maples, hemlocks, birches, ashes, sweet gums, and other deciduous species. Common plants are wild azaleas, rhododendrons, honeysuckles, mountain laurels, wintergreen, and cardinal flowers.</p>
<p>The marshy area west of The Palisades (the Hackensack Meadows, popularly called the Meadowlands) and the Great Swamp of Morris county are relics of glacial lakes of the last Ice Age. The former is dominated by grasses, the latter by trees. The Meadowlands are managed to encourage wise land use and pollution abatement. The Great Swamp, one of several poorly drained areas in the Passaic River basin, is a national wildlife refuge. Elsewhere, increasing suburban development has encroached on wildlife habitats; bears and especially deer have become serious pests. Raccoons and opossums are common, even in many suburbs, and other mammals, snakes, and birds common to the northeastern United States (including migratory species) are also found within the state.</p>
<h2 id="People"><a href="#People" class="headerlink" title="People"></a>People</h2><h3 id="Population-composition"><a href="#Population-composition" class="headerlink" title="Population composition"></a>Population composition</h3><p>New Jersey’s population reflects the immigration patterns of the 19th and 20th centuries, including Germans and Slavs, Russian and European Jews, Irish, and Italians. Those categorized as white (i.e., generally of European origin) constitute more than two-thirds of the population. New Jersey was a prime destination for the waves of African Americans who left the South during and after World War II; more than one-tenth of the state’s total population is made up of African Americans. There is also a sizable Hispanic population, the largest subgroups of which are Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Cubans. In the late 20th century, immigrant groups began to grow even more diverse and included South Asians, Portuguese, different Latin American groups, and others.</p>
<p>Italian Americans are the state’s largest ethnic group. They are the predominant white bloc in the cities, although the cities also contain sizable Polish, Hungarian, and other eastern European groups. Italian Americans and African Americans dominate the political and cultural life of the cities—a situation that at times has brought the two groups into competition and conflict.</p>
<h3 id="Settlement-patterns"><a href="#Settlement-patterns" class="headerlink" title="Settlement patterns"></a>Settlement patterns</h3><p>The most distinctive of New Jersey’s regions is its long shoreline, which stretches for 125 miles (200 km). Much of it is composed of long and narrow barrier islands separated from the mainland by shallow lagoons and from one another by tidal inlets. Cape May, at the southern tip of the state, was among the first summer resorts in the country, and both that community and Long Branch in Monmouth county were known as the playgrounds of presidents during the 19th century. The quality of the Shore, as it is called, ranges from the urban garishness of Asbury Park to the opulence of Deal and Mantoloking. In such resorts as Wildwood and Atlantic City, the nightlife goes until dawn, whereas other seaside towns such as Avalon, Ocean City, and Beach Haven are family resorts. The Jersey Shore at its best can be found in two parks, Sandy Hook (part of Gateway National Recreation Area) in the north and Island Beach, a state park, in the south. The dunes there are still topped with coarse but fragile grass, and osprey still build their nests there. The marshes teem with wildlife, and the trees are bent and twisted by wind and salt spray. More than two-fifths of the land is forested.</p>
<p>Five northeastern counties in the New York City metropolitan area—Essex, Hudson, Passaic, Bergen, and Union—contain nearly two-fifths of New Jersey’s population. Four of the six largest cities in the state—Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Elizabeth—are located there. The Newark–Hudson county–Elizabeth complex appears to many travelers as one endless industrial city: dingy and smelly but throbbing with commercial life.</p>
<p>Beyond the cities lie the suburbs. Most are pleasant and prosperous, but some of the older ones show signs of urban blight. Industrial construction in suburban communities has increased, but many suburban towns, especially in Bergen county, remain bedroom communities of New York City and of the New Jersey cities. Newark’s population doubles every day as the workforce pours in. New Jersey remains dominated, however, by the two giant cities just beyond its borders. Hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans cross the Hudson to New York City on the average workday. North Jerseyans watch New York television, root (for the most part) for New York athletic teams, and patronize New York theatres and restaurants. A similar situation exists in Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, and Mercer counties, where residents cross the Delaware to jobs in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>South Jersey begins south of Trenton and comprises most of eight counties. It includes roughly half of the state’s area but only about one-fourth of the population. The loamy soil of the Inner Coastal Plain is well suited to vegetable farming, and most of the land not covered by forest or marsh is farmed. Pinelands National Reserve, covering about 1,700 square miles (4,400 square km) in the Outer Coastal Plain, was established in 1978; it was the country’s first national reserve, in which the federal government provided funds for the purchase of a core of undeveloped land while state and local authorities were responsible for resource evaluation and economic planning in surrounding developed areas.</p>
<p>Central Jersey, all of five counties and part of three, is largely a plain, but hilly areas occur in Hunterdon and Somerset counties. Middlesex and Mercer counties, especially the former, are industrialized. Princeton University is located in Mercer county and the borough of Princeton, which combines the charm of the campus with a rich colonial past to create one of the country’s loveliest towns. Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, has its main campus in nearby New Brunswick. Hunterdon and Somerset counties are a mixture of suburban development, farmland, and woodland.</p>
<p>The four counties of northwestern New Jersey comprise a mixture of small town, affluent suburb, and rugged countryside, although two major cities, Passaic and Paterson, are located in Passaic county. The area contains some remaining dairy farms and parks and recreation areas.</p>
<p>Although relatively small, the Meadowlands are immensely valuable because of their location in the centre of one of the world’s busiest metropolitan areas. By the late 1960s, New Jersey had put together the machinery to develop this area through the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission (now the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission). In 1976 the Meadowlands Sports Complex began operations with the opening of a racetrack. In 1976 Giants (gridiron football) Stadium was completed, and the Continental Airlines Arena (formerly the Brendan Byrne Arena) opened in 1981. Warehouses and corporate buildings have also been constructed in the area.</p>
<h3 id="Demographic-trends"><a href="#Demographic-trends" class="headerlink" title="Demographic trends"></a>Demographic trends</h3><p>The most striking demographic trend in New Jersey is the movement of the white population away from the cities and the concurrent proportional growth of the urban black and Hispanic population, accompanied by an emigration of industry and commerce. Old, outmoded factories are left behind for sleek new buildings outside cities, and huge suburban shopping centres have replaced the downtown department stores. This shift means more jobs in the suburbs, and the jobs create a commensurate demand for housing. The populations of the cities bordering those areas have become increasingly African American and Hispanic, and the cities suffer from continuing decay and poor-quality housing and services.</p>
<h2 id="Economy"><a href="#Economy" class="headerlink" title="Economy"></a>Economy</h2><p>Alexander Hamilton’s attempt in 1791 to build the country’s first industrial town at Paterson was initially a failure. He had the right idea, however, for New Jersey was destined to become an industrial giant. Although New Jersey remains an important manufacturing state, employment in that sector has declined. Today, jobs in the service sector outnumber manufacturing jobs more than three to one. Nonetheless, the State Division of Economic Development, along with the major utilities and business organizations, has conducted an effective program of marketing New Jersey to industry. New Jersey has continued to attract many industries, especially corporate headquarters from New York City, largely through its greater space, better transportation, and favourable tax rates.</p>
<h3 id="Agriculture-forestry-and-fishing"><a href="#Agriculture-forestry-and-fishing" class="headerlink" title="Agriculture, forestry, and fishing"></a>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing</h3><p>The spread of industry and housing since the late 20th century has cost New Jersey much of its farmland, which has become the most valuable per acre in the United States. Farms cover about one-sixth of the state’s land area. Less than 1 percent of the state’s population is engaged in farming, but farm income per acre is among the highest in the country. New Jersey farmers grow a large variety of fruits and vegetables, including blueberries, cranberries, peaches, asparagus, bell peppers, and the famous New Jersey tomatoes. Greenhouse products, dairy products, and fruits account for the vast majority of the state’s total farm income.</p>
<p>The vast majority of timberland in New Jersey is privately owned, and the state has a small but vibrant forestry sector. Likewise, fishing constitutes a small but significant component of the state’s economy. Based in Cape May and other ports along the Jersey Shore, the sector lands a great variety of seafood (notably shellfish) annually. The state has been actively promoting aquaculture since the mid-1990s.</p>
<h3 id="Resources-manufacturing-and-power"><a href="#Resources-manufacturing-and-power" class="headerlink" title="Resources, manufacturing, and power"></a>Resources, manufacturing, and power</h3><p>The state was once renowned for its mineral deposits, notably iron ores, and New Jersey provided much of the iron used to make artillery during the American Revolution. Now, nearly all raw materials and fossil fuels must be imported; sand and stone are the most important minerals exploited. New Jersey’s major industries include the production of chemicals and the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment, textiles, food, toys, sporting goods, and stone, glass, and clay products. About half of the state’s electricity is generated by thermal plants and the other half at nuclear facilities, with a tiny proportion from other sources.</p>
<h3 id="Services-labour-and-taxation"><a href="#Services-labour-and-taxation" class="headerlink" title="Services, labour, and taxation"></a>Services, labour, and taxation</h3><p>New Jersey has a large and prestigious research sector, with one of the country’s highest numbers of engineers and scientists per capita. The great inventor Thomas Alva Edison established a research laboratory in Menlo Park in 1876. There he created the incandescent lamp and the phonograph and pioneered motion-picture technology. Today the landscape of the central part of the state is replete with the research facilities of international repute that have succeeded Edison’s pioneering laboratory.</p>
<p>Resorts and tourism are a significant part of New Jersey’s economy, especially in the south, where a bad year at the Shore hurts the economic well-being of the entire region. Gambling has contributed greatly to the service sector since the mid-1970s, when residents of New Jersey approved a constitutional amendment to permit gambling casinos at Atlantic City.</p>
<p>New Jersey has one of the country’s highest rates of union membership among employed workers. In absolute terms it has one of the highest numbers of union members, despite the state’s small size. This high participation level reflects the degree of New Jersey’s industrialization and organized labour’s long history in the state. Among the many significant labour strikes have been those of silk workers in Paterson in 1913 and of woolen-mill workers in Passaic in 1926.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s greatest source of tax revenue is individual and corporate income taxes, followed closely by various sales taxes. Licenses and property taxes provide smaller portions of revenue.</p>
<h3 id="Transportation"><a href="#Transportation" class="headerlink" title="Transportation"></a>Transportation</h3><p>Since colonial days, when New Jersey’s roads first linked Philadelphia and New York City, transportation has been the lifeblood of the state’s economy, and its role in New Jersey can best be appreciated in the Newark area. There, a dozen lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike converge with the main line of Conrail (Consolidated Rail Corporation), Newark Liberty International Airport, Port Newark, and the Elizabeth–Port Authority Marine Terminal to provide one of the world’s most dynamic transportation landscapes.</p>
<p>The economy of northern New Jersey is bound tightly to that of New York City, and the commercial traffic between the two states is the country’s heaviest. In 1921 the states of New York and New Jersey formed the Port of New York Authority, now called the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey—a bistate commission empowered to finance and operate transportation facilities in the New York metropolitan area. The Port Authority, as it is known, is a public corporation operating Newark and Teterboro airports in New Jersey and La Guardia and Kennedy airports in New York, as well as the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, three bridges, huge piers, bus and rail lines, and truck terminals.</p>
<p>A similar but much smaller transit complex exists in the Camden area and links the South Jersey area with Philadelphia. Camden has a deepwater port on the Delaware River and high-speed transit to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Even before World War II, New Jersey had one of the country’s finest road networks, and it subsequently built an extensive network of toll highways. The New Jersey Turnpike runs the length of the state from the George Washington Bridge in the northeast to the Delaware Memorial Bridge in the southwest. The Garden State Parkway stretches southward along the eastern side of the state from the New York state line nearly to Cape May, and the Atlantic City Expressway connects Atlantic City with the Camden area to the northwest.</p>
<h2 id="Government-and-society"><a href="#Government-and-society" class="headerlink" title="Government and society"></a>Government and society</h2><h3 id="Constitutional-framework"><a href="#Constitutional-framework" class="headerlink" title="Constitutional framework"></a>Constitutional framework</h3><p>New Jersey has had three constitutions. The current constitution dates from 1947 and has been amended many times. New Jersey governors serve terms of four years, and they are permitted reelection to a second term. The governor appoints, with the advice and consent of the Senate (one of the state legislature’s two chambers; the lower house is called the General Assembly), virtually all top state officers and members of state boards, state authorities, and the judiciary; the governor also has the authority to supersede county prosecutors. By virtue of having broad executive and administrative powers, a vast patronage network, and unequaled access to the press, radio, and television, the governor of New Jersey is a relatively strong chief executive. A two-thirds majority of both legislative houses is necessary to override a gubernatorial veto.</p>
<p>In 1966, in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, the New Jersey legislature adopted the “one man, one vote” principle. Voters in each of the state’s 40 districts choose one senator and two General Assembly members. Assembly members serve two-year terms. The Senate operates on a “2-4-4” cycle; senators are elected to four-year terms, except at the beginning of a decade, when they serve a two-year term. This allows for new elections as soon as possible after the reapportionment that occurs following the decennial census.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s 21 counties are administered by boards of freeholders elected countywide. The boards vary from three to nine members, depending on the size of the county. In addition to these elected officials, local governments are supplemented by service commissions, boards, and authorities, many of which enjoy wide independence and even autonomy. Attempts to merge municipalities, reduce the number of school districts by consolidation, or strengthen county government have not been successful; local power and prerogatives are important determinants in New Jersey politics.</p>
<p>Although there have been signs that civic bossism is declining, New Jersey’s political system was long dominated by strong county leaders who drew their power from the patronage and contracts that they dispensed through control of the municipal courthouse or city hall. The most notorious of those bosses was Frank Hague, who ruled Jersey City and Hudson county from 1917 to 1947. For three decades Hague dominated the Democratic Party and heavily influenced the Republicans. His philosophy of government was best summed up in his famous reply to those who told him an order he gave was against the law: “I am the law.”</p>
<h3 id="Education"><a href="#Education" class="headerlink" title="Education"></a>Education</h3><p>Public elementary and secondary schools in New Jersey are largely locally funded and controlled. There was no state university until 1946, when New Jersey took over full responsibility for Rutgers. Rutgers, which began as Queen’s College in 1766, is today composed of three campuses (New Brunswick [main campus], Newark, and Camden) and a wide variety of colleges and programs. Princeton University (formerly the College of New Jersey; 1746), an Ivy League school, is one of the country’s most prestigious private institutions. Princeton Theological Seminary and the Institute for Advanced Study are also located in Princeton. Other institutions of higher learning include the College of New Jersey (public; 1855), in Trenton; Seton Hall University (Roman Catholic; 1856), in South Orange; and Stevens Institute of Technology (private; 1870), in Hoboken.</p>
<h3 id="Health-and-welfare"><a href="#Health-and-welfare" class="headerlink" title="Health and welfare"></a>Health and welfare</h3><p>Most of the services available to the citizens of New Jersey come from the state, although most of the major counties maintain institutions of one kind or another, and much funding comes through federal agencies.</p>
<h2 id="Cultural-life"><a href="#Cultural-life" class="headerlink" title="Cultural life"></a>Cultural life</h2><p>New Jersey long has been well served by the cultural amenities of New York City and Philadelphia, and therefore the state lagged somewhat in developing its own. New Jersey helped correct that situation with the 1968 opening, in Holmdel, of the Garden State (now PNC Bank) Arts Center. The New Jersey Performing Arts Center (opened 1997), in downtown Newark, holds performances by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. These facilities have proved to be a success, and their programming of music, drama, and dance has been well received.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been the home and inspiration for a large number of popular musicians. Among those most strongly associated with the state have been Bruce Springsteen, who grew up in Freehold but whose early music was indelibly linked to the Jersey Shore, and Hoboken native Frank Sinatra, who was discovered by bandleader Harry James while singing at a New Jersey venue. Other notable performers from the state include Sarah Vaughan, Dionne Warwick, Whitney Houston, and the heavy metal band Bon Jovi.</p>
<p>There are several summer theatres in New Jersey, most of them located near vacation areas. The McCarter Theatre Center, on the Princeton University campus, is open throughout the year and presents high-quality plays, music, and dance performances. Theatrical events and concerts also take place at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford. Best known as a sports venue, however, the Meadowlands is home to professional athletic teams of both New York and New Jersey. Among the teams that play there are the Jets and the Giants (gridiron football) and the Red Bulls (football [soccer]). The complex includes a horse-racing track where the Hambletonian Stake is run annually. The Devils (ice hockey) play at the Prudential Center in Newark; that venue also hosts other sports teams (professional and amateur), as well as entertainment events.</p>
<p>New Jersey has dozens of museums, many of them operated in conjunction with historic sites or buildings. The New Jersey State Museum, which includes a planetarium, is located in the state capitol complex in Trenton. Rutgers University’s Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum (formerly the Rutgers University Art Gallery), one of the country’s largest university art museums, houses important collections of Russian and Soviet art and 19th- and 20th-century French prints. The Newark Museum and the Princeton University Art Museum are among other well-known institutions.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s rich traditions are manifested in such historic homes and sites as the Rockingham State Historic Site, Washington’s winter headquarters near Princeton, where he wrote his farewell address to the Continental Army; Morven Museum and Garden (1755), in Princeton, located in the former governor’s mansion and onetime home of Richard Stockton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; the restored 18th- and 19th-century colonial villages of Batsto and Allaire; and the Camden home of poet Walt Whitman. These and other historic sites attract thousands of tourists each year. New Jersey also operates a system of more than 35 state parks, about a dozen forests, several national recreation areas, some 40 natural areas, and several state marinas. Washington Crossing State Park is located in Trenton. Great Falls State Park, in Paterson, features 77-foot- (23-metre-) high falls and restored historic mill buildings and raceways.</p>
<h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><h3 id="The-colony"><a href="#The-colony" class="headerlink" title="The colony"></a>The colony</h3><p>Before the Europeans arrived, the Delaware (or Lenni Lenape) Indians had long occupied the region. In 1524 the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to reach New Jersey. Almost a century passed before colonization began with the arrival in 1609 of the English navigator Henry Hudson, who sent a party to explore Sandy Hook Bay. The first permanent European settlement was established by the Dutch at Bergen (now Jersey City) in 1660. The colony was brought under English rule in 1664, although for the next nine years the Dutch disputed that claim. In 1676 the province was divided into East and West Jersey, the former going to Sir George Carteret and the latter to a group of Friends (Quakers). The division continued until 1702, when the entire province reverted to the crown.</p>
<p>Unlike other colonists, who suffered from the harshness of English rule, the early Jerseyans were of such an independent nature that it was the royal governors who did much of the suffering. Until 1738 a single governor ruled New Jersey and New York. When Lewis Morris took office as the first governor of New Jersey after the separation, one member of the Assembly advised his colleagues on how governors should be treated: “Let us keep the doges poore [i.e., by paying governors a low salary] and wee’ll make them do as we please.”</p>
<h3 id="Revolution-and-statehood"><a href="#Revolution-and-statehood" class="headerlink" title="Revolution and statehood"></a>Revolution and statehood</h3><p>Considerable division occurred within the state over the American Revolution, and Tory activity was heavy. The state was the site of more than 100 battles, earning it the nickname Crossroads of the Revolution. The most significant of these took place on Dec. 26, 1776, when Gen. George Washington and his hungry, ragged troops crossed the Delaware River from Pennsylvania in Durham boats (shallow-draft freight vessels), surprised a garrison of German mercenaries in Trenton, and captured the city. A week later, Washington won another vital battle at Princeton, routing the British forces under Col. Charles Mawhood. The victories breathed new life into the Revolution, and an army of colonials near despair was transformed into an effective fighting force. During the war Long Pond Ironworks and Batsto Iron Works (both founded 1766) supplied munitions to American troops. In 1776 New Jersey adopted its first constitution, which granted suffrage to women (although the legislature revoked this right in 1807). In 1787 it became the third state to ratify the U.S. Constitution. Trenton, which had served briefly as the national capital in 1784, was made the state capital in 1790. In its early years of statehood, New Jersey concentrated on rebuilding its economy from the damage done during the war.</p>
<h3 id="Growth-of-the-contemporary-state"><a href="#Growth-of-the-contemporary-state" class="headerlink" title="Growth of the contemporary state"></a>Growth of the contemporary state</h3><p>Between the Revolutionary and Civil wars, New Jersey underwent tremendous industrial development, largely abetted by the construction of canals and, later, railroads. The railroads, in particular the Camden and Amboy line (a forerunner of present-day Conrail), played a crucial role in the state’s political life, dominating and controlling legislators and governors during the “robber baron” era of industrial expansion in the 19th century. Accommodating tax laws of that era gave New Jersey the epithet Mother of Trusts—half of the country’s largest corporations made their headquarters in the state by the early 1900s. Public dissatisfaction with the power of the trusts and public utilities reached a high point at the time of the election of Gov. Woodrow Wilson (1911–13), who signed legislation providing for tighter regulation of corporations (later repealed). Economic growth continued during and after World Wars I and II, but the growing decay of the cities continued to be largely overlooked amid general prosperity throughout the 20th century.<br>Politically, New Jersey is often a swing state in national elections. It historically tended to lean Republican, but, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, voters more decidedly supported the Democrats, who have since frequently controlled the state legislature. The governorship has tended to alternate between Republican and Democrat. In 1993 Republican Christine Todd Whitman became the first female governor of New Jersey.</p>
<p>A master plan for the state’s development, first adopted in 1992 and subsequently updated, aimed to direct growth toward existing infrastructure. The goal was to benefit existing urban and older suburban areas and to protect the state’s natural resources. The state also committed to the acquisition of open space and the reduction of suburban sprawl and its concomitant difficulties for commuters. Simultaneously, there was a rise of “edge cities” (suburban areas that contain all or most of the functions once found only in an urban context). As New Jersey moves through its fourth century of history, it continues to fulfill its potential as a diverse and richly gifted state.</p>

  <h3 id="1-Get-the-basics-right"><a href="#1-Get-the-basics-right" class="headerlink" title="1. Get the basics right"></a><strong>1. Get the basics right</strong></h3><p>As Java offers so many features and options to the developers, people are sometimes lured into learning too many things in too little time. As a result of this, they get ‘bits and pieces’ knowledge of a few options that Java offers, but their basics hang on a loose thread. Trust me when I say this, Java is one programming language which is easy if you have paid attention to the simple basics, however; it can be frustrating if you get greedy and try to take the shorter route forward.</p>
<h3 id="2-Don’t-just-read"><a href="#2-Don’t-just-read" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t just read"></a><strong>2. Don’t just read</strong></h3><p>Well, if your sole purpose of learning Java is to clear the exam you have the next day, go ahead and mug up all the things that you can and you might just get the passing marks. However; if you are really serious about learning Java and getting better at it, the best way to do it is not by reading, but by implementing. Gain knowledge and then execute what you have learnt, in the form of code. You can never learn Java if you are not willing to get your hands dirty.</p>
<h3 id="3-Understand-your-code-and-algorithm"><a href="#3-Understand-your-code-and-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand your code and algorithm"></a><strong>3. Understand your code and algorithm</strong></h3><p>Even if you are writing a simple code having a ‘if else’ statement, as a beginner, start by realizing the code on a piece of paper. The algorithm and the whole compiler process will look so meaningful once you understand the idea behind the code. Even for experts, the best way to solve a complex problem or to formulate an algorithm to solve a Java program is to break the problem into sub-parts and then try to devise a solution for each sub part. When you start getting the solutions right, you will get the confidence to work more.</p>
<h3 id="4-Do-not-forget-to-allocate-memory"><a href="#4-Do-not-forget-to-allocate-memory" class="headerlink" title="4. Do not forget to allocate memory"></a><strong>4. Do not forget to allocate memory</strong></h3><p>This tip is particularly useful for those who switch from C, C++ to Java. The memory allocation in Java using the ‘new’ keyword is a necessity as Java is a dynamic programming language. C, C++ does not explicitly have this feature, therefore you must take care while handling array and object declaration in Java. Not using the ‘new’ keyword will show a null pointer exception in the code.</p>
<h3 id="5-Avoid-creating-useless-objects"><a href="#5-Avoid-creating-useless-objects" class="headerlink" title="5. Avoid creating useless objects"></a><strong>5. Avoid creating useless objects</strong></h3><p>When you create an object in Java, you use up memory and processor speed from the system. Since object creation is incomplete without allocating memory to it, it is better to keep the object requirements under check and not create unwanted objects in the code.</p>
<h3 id="6-Interface-is-better-than-Abstract-class"><a href="#6-Interface-is-better-than-Abstract-class" class="headerlink" title="6. Interface is better than Abstract class"></a><strong>6. Interface is better than Abstract class</strong></h3><p>There is no multiple inheritance in Java, and this will be spoon fed to you so many times while learning the language that you will probably never forget it for the rest of your life. However; the tip here in not to remember that there is no multiple inheritance in Java, but the fact that interface will come in handy if you want to implement something like multiple inheritance without using the extends keyword. Remember, in Java, when nothing goes your way, you will always have interface by your side. Abstract class does not always give programmers the liberty of having a variety of methods to work with, however; interface only have abstract methods therefore is does the job of abstract classes and has other advantages as well. </p>
<h3 id="7-Standard-library-is-a-bliss"><a href="#7-Standard-library-is-a-bliss" class="headerlink" title="7. Standard library is a bliss"></a><strong>7. Standard library is a bliss</strong></h3><p>The biggest advantage that Java has over its predecessors, from a programming point of view, is probably its rich set of standard library methods. Using Java’s standard library makes the job of a programmer easy, more efficient and gives a well organised flow to the code. Further, operations can be performed easily on the methods specified in the library. </p>
<h3 id="8-Prefer-Primitive-classes-over-Wrapper-Class"><a href="#8-Prefer-Primitive-classes-over-Wrapper-Class" class="headerlink" title="8. Prefer Primitive classes over Wrapper Class"></a><strong>8. Prefer Primitive classes over Wrapper Class</strong></h3><p>Wrapper classes are no doubt, of great utility, but they are often slower than primitive classes. Primitive class only has values while the wrapper class stores information about the entire class. Further, since wrapper classes often deal with object values, comparing them like the primitive classes does not give desired results as it ends up comparing objects instead of values stored in it.</p>
<h3 id="9-Dealing-with-strings"><a href="#9-Dealing-with-strings" class="headerlink" title="9. Dealing with strings"></a><strong>9. Dealing with strings</strong></h3><p>Since Object oriented programming classifies String as a class, a simple concatenation of two strings might result into the creation of a new string object in Java which eventually affects the memory and speed of the system. It is always better to instantiate a string object directly, without using the constructor for this purpose.</p>
<h3 id="10-Code-Code-Code"><a href="#10-Code-Code-Code" class="headerlink" title="10. Code, Code, Code"></a><strong>10. Code, Code, Code</strong></h3><p>There is so much to learn about Java that you just cannot get over with this programming language and it keeps getting more interesting and amusing, however; it is important to maintain the interest within to learn and the hunger to get better. A programming language like Java can be learnt on our own and with great success, but the only thing that is required is continuous learning and coding to test what you have learnt. Java is a lot like playing a sport; the more you sweat in the practice, less you bleed in the match.</p>

  <p>虽然表面上看起来很美好，皆大欢喜，但是我觉得三个小孩里严良和普普已经死了，老陈或许也不在了。</p>
<p>1.开场动画三个小人被追杀，最后只剩下一个躲在黑暗里。</p>
<p>2.普普哮喘发作，张东升产生的一丝恻隐之心在听到医院问及地址立马就消散了，挂了电话。这样不愿跟三孩子扯上关系的他可能会把普普送到医院吗？何况当时普普已经昏厥过去，吸氧都不能，送去也很难说来得及了。后面她也再没出现过。</p>
<p>有个花絮张东升一个人吃着三份麦当劳套餐痛哭，之前他答应过带普普来点三份，这证明了普普的去世。不过这段被删了。</p>
<p>3.朱朝阳在读普普写给他的信泪流满面，全剧他只哭过三次，之前都是很受伤的事。为何如此伤感？</p>
<p>4.严良在船上掉下去就死了。老陈腹部重伤住院，上厕所都要老伴扶着，才几天突然就能没事人一样下水救人（在周边那么多jc的情况下让他一个伤员下水救援就不科学），还及时赶上准确无误救下了严良，这未免太像张东升和朱朝阳口中的童话了。</p>
<p>如果仔细看可以看到他之前还是捂着肚子走，水里捞起严良就安然无恙一般生龙活虎的给严良做心肺复苏（我觉得可能这时老陈就没了）。如果普普已死确立，那么后面说普普配型成功的严良和老陈就更不真实了。</p>
<p>5.礼堂那个画面仿佛天堂来客，配的音乐也是所谓的“阴间”音乐，严良一个外校人淡定走进学校礼堂，全校师生跟没看见一样，只有朱朝阳转过头。</p>
<p>严良看朱朝阳的眼神明显带着不满，作为一个算得上有正义感的人，他根本不原谅朱朝阳，如果这是朱朝阳幻想中的童话日记，那还是隐喻了一部分现实。那就是证明了他作的恶，他复制卡的谎言与故意传播害死了普普。温暖的画面配不安的音乐，漠然的与仇视的眼神的对视，绝了。</p>
<p>甚至在船上严良挂了那么久，朱朝阳也并没有伸手拉他一把，就这样眼睁睁看着他掉下去。已经很明显了。</p>
<p>6.至于朱晶晶的死，在我看来已经算明喻了。最后普普信里说的这个真相她连严良都没告诉，那对应她前几集对严良说看见朱晶晶自己摔死了，就可以得出朱晶晶绝对不是意外摔死。要么朱朝阳推下去，要么他见死不救，个人倾向他有看到朱晶晶挂在外面（有衣物挂在外面）并助推，不然只是冷眼旁观的话，他与普普份量是一样的，普普不必要在信里说希望朱朝阳承认真相重新开始。</p>
<p>那个柔光画面（与普普回忆家人的滤镜如出一辙，代表虚假与谎言）朱朝阳探头去看，随后黑屏，出现一段小女孩的哭声，再才是坠地声。坐实了朱晶晶是在外面挂住了没人救才摔下去的。</p>
<p>朱朝阳最后一集说出的后悔给他们开门也印证了他黑化后对朋友截然相反的态度。我觉得他黑化的几个关键点一是被亲爸猜忌，二是被后妈羞辱与王立三番两次置其于死地，三是亲眼目睹张东升杀人现场（质变的一次）。</p>
<p>担心严良在解决张东升的事后主动自首暴露了自己，所以朱朝阳隐瞒了王立绑架自己/张东升杀王立事件（既能在亲爹那刷好感，离间亲爹与后妈关系，又能拉拢张东升，利用他做侩子手除去自己要除掉的人），也开始对朋友目的不纯，不择手段。</p>
<p>他最后两集两次问严良“报警吗”就有了杀意（有趣的是刚开始看到杀人事件先提出报警的是朱朝阳，被不想送回福利院的严良阻止。而后面反过来，是朱朝阳不想严良报警），在看到张东升与其他两人“其乐融融”的情况下，他故意说复制卡的事，并祸水东引到严良。嘴上说着销毁，但他清楚严良不会销毁（毕竟对杀人犯总有戒备心），因此严良必会被张东升视为眼中钉除掉。</p>
<p>结尾他一通电话把两人引到轮船上，说走到尽头就可以看到自己，结果却是让张东升和严良碰头，导致他们打起来。有个猜想是严良是在这里被张东升杀死的。未成年人严良肯定打不过张东升，就算打架经验多，但张东升毕竟杀过那么多人，连王立这种坐过牢的地痞流氓都能干掉。而且当时张东升已经掐住了严良脖子举起了刀，按照这个动势和张东升杀人干脆利落的性格放过他太奇怪了。也已经出现悲凉的配乐与严良遗言一类的话。后面那个严良可能就是朱朝阳想象出来的劝自己不要下手的正面形象，在他童话里这是要当jc的人也说的过去。</p>
<p>普普属于意外情况不在他计划之内，但是他防备普普的一个重要原因就是担心普普把朱晶晶事件告诉严良，所以结局看到信哭出来除了为她的死，还有就是愧疚感。</p>
<p>最后一次朱朝阳跟妈妈吃饭笑着说自己成绩又是第一名，妈妈脸上已经没有笑容，在父亲刚死的情况下还笑得出来跟母亲讲成绩，朱朝阳已经没那么在乎父子情。这个剧里的母亲直觉都很准（包括没有证据就死揪着朱朝阳不放的后妈），或许母亲早就察觉到了儿子身上的变化超出了自己的控制，而无力挽回。</p>
<p>当初三人一起在船上飞往月球的美梦，终于变成了一个阴暗中孤独生长的“旭日东升”。张东升与朱朝阳有许多共通之处，都热爱数学，都喜欢笛卡尔，相信事物的两面性，有阳光的名字与阴暗的个性，都可以为了得到至亲心目中的第一顺位而对关系不好的亲人痛下杀手，甚至都爱穿白衬衫。后期还有种亦师亦友的惺惺相惜之感。在船上那番交接，也是彻底失败的张东升把这面阴暗的旗帜递交到加强版自己朱朝阳手上的节点。只是朱朝阳做的更不露声色，成功将自己伪造成了一名受害者，以至于演的都感动了自己。</p>

  <p>Pistol / Handgun - The handgun is a firearm designed to be held in the palm of one hand and intended to be fired as such (though two hands are generally used for accuracy with the weapon held away from the body at arm’s length). The handgun takes on various forms including the early single-shot forms, the later revolver-type forms and the modern semi-automatic pistol. Handguns given full-automatic fire are generally classified as’machine pistols’ for their firepower as related to a machine gun. EXAMPLES: .44 Magnum; Flintlock Pistol; Walther P99; Colt M1911.</p>
<p>Musket - Muskets appeared around the 16th Century and managed an existence into the 19th Century. These firearms utilized a long, smoothbore barrel for range, were operated from the shoulder utilizing a two-hand hold and fired a spherical metal ball. Muskets were muzzle-loading instruments (that is, loaded from the barrel) which made them time-consuming to reload, forcing lines of infantry (musketeers) to be used in formation. The introduction of rifling brought about the classification of ‘rifled musket’ detailed next.</p>
<p>Rifled Musket - Rifling was the gunsmithing practice of adding grooves within the bore of a barrel to help a bullet retain accuracy and range once it left the weapon. Many smoothbore muskets were converted by rifling to become ‘Rifled Muskets’, a sort of interim design between the original musket and the newfangled ‘rifle’. The introduction of the breech loading cartridge all but killed the musket as a viable firearm.</p>
<p>Rifle - Rifle is a general term used to represent a modern-day ‘long gun’ featuring ‘rifling’ inside the barrel that promotes accuracy at range and is able to be fired from the shoulder using both hands to complete the three-point hold. Rifles include the sub-groups of Battle Rifle and Assault Rifle.</p>
<p>Battle Rifle - The Battle Rifle appeared after World War 2 and was an automatic ‘long gun’ that utilized a full-power rifle-based cartridge. Battle Rifles formed many of the frontline service rifles of the Cold War and were primarily centered around the 7.62x51mm cartridge in the West. EXAMPLES: HK G3; M14; FN FAL.</p>
<p>Assault Rifle - Classification falls between submachine gun and light machine gun. Assault rifles are today’s modern frontline service rifles, having replaced the Battle Rifle used during the Cold War. An assault rifle is categorized by its use of an’intermediate’cartridge size (that is, less than a full-power rifle cartridge - ex: 7.62x54mmR) coupled with a detachable box magazine. The German WW2-era StG 44 is largely accepted as the first’true’ assault rifle. EXAMPLES: Colt M16; Kalashnikov AK-47; L85A1; HK G36.</p>
<p>Carbine - Carbines are generally shortened forms of existing long guns and can be based on muskets or rifled automatic weapons. The carbine retains the capability to fire a full-power rifle cartridge though this is delivered in a more compact form brought about by shortening the barrel and forend assemblies. Due to the modifications, carbines generally lose accuracy at range though they are intended as close-quarter weapons. Carbines fall between submachine guns and assault rifle concepts. EXAMPLES: KAR 98K; CAR-15; M1 Carbine; M4 Carbine.</p>
<p>Submachine Gun - Submachine Guns are automatic weapons of compact size when compared to their larger rifle cousins. Submachine guns also feature rifled barrels but barrels that are shorter in length to promote the compact sizes required of this weapon class. Additionally, submachine guns generally utilize pistol cartridges which are lower-powered when compared to full-size long guns but carry inherent man-stopping capabilities all their own. The earliest ‘true’ submachine gun was the German WW1-era Bergmann MP18 which saw extended service into WW2. EXAMPLES: HK MP5; MP38/40; STEN Gun; UZI 9mm; AKSU-74.</p>
<p>Designated Marksman Rifle - Designated Marksman Rifles (DMR) are automatic weapons outfitted with sniper-type optics and issued to squad-level sharpshooters. DMR personnel fall between the standard frontline infantryman and the dedicated sniper element and their weapons are modified to suit the role. Modifications include the installation of optics and a bipod for accuracy at range. Their weapons are generally full-sized long guns firing a full-power rifle cartridge from a high-count detachable box magazine through a semi-automatic action (one bullet fired for every trigger pull). They may actually be modified Battle Rifles detailed above. EXAMPLES: M14; FN FAL; AR-10; HK G3.</p>
<p>Sniper Rifle - Sniper Rifles are operated by specially trained shooters centered on accuracy against targets at long ranges. Weapons are typically very accurized systems with optics, bipods and adjustable shoulder stocks as standard. Traditional sniper rifles are also manually-actuated bolt-action weapons that require the operator to move the bolt handle to introduce a cartridge into the firing chamber. Sniper rifles are nearly always chambered for the 7.62mm full-power rifle cartridge for its range and man-stopping qualities. EXAMPLES: Remington M40; Mosin-Nagant; H-S Precision Pro Series 2000.</p>
<p>Anti-Material Rifle - Anti-Material Rifles owe their existence to the bolt-action rifles of old. The first anti-material rifle was developed by the German Army in World War 1 to counter the threat posed by British tanks (‘Landships’). The anti-material rifle is centered on the firing of a full-power large caliber cartridge - typically the 12.7x99mm NATO (.50 BMG), the 14.5x114mm Russian or, most recently, the 20mm cartridge. Their intent is to engage critical components of an armored vehicle, disabling key systems that would render the vehicle inoperable. Additionally, anti-material rifles can engage various other targets including communications equipment and even personnel - in the latter case having a truly disastrous effect on the target. Anti-material rifles have grown in popularity over the recent decades as they become more of a primary fixture on the modern battlefield.</p>

  <h2 id="1-Allowing-Paper-Clutter-to-Accumulate"><a href="#1-Allowing-Paper-Clutter-to-Accumulate" class="headerlink" title="1. Allowing Paper Clutter to Accumulate"></a>1. Allowing Paper Clutter to Accumulate</h2><p>Even with online billing and banking, there is still a mountain of paper that ends up in our homes. Magazines, newspapers, school papers and projects; they have a tendency to pile up. Don’t let that happen.</p>
<p>Designate a place near the entryway for all mail, periodicals, and paper forms and keep a shredder or recycling bin close by. At least once a week, sort through and complete the needed action or toss. </p>
<p>File important papers like tax receipts. Take digital photos of children’s special artwork or frame them for display. Share magazines with retirement homes, schools, or simply read the articles online.</p>
<h2 id="2-Leaving-Wet-Towels-and-Shower-Curtains-Bunched-Up"><a href="#2-Leaving-Wet-Towels-and-Shower-Curtains-Bunched-Up" class="headerlink" title="2. Leaving Wet Towels and Shower Curtains Bunched Up"></a>2. Leaving Wet Towels and Shower Curtains Bunched Up</h2><p>Want to spend less time in the laundry room and scrubbing mildew from bathroom surfaces? Don’t leave wet shower curtains bunched up and wet towels in a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>This is one of the simplest bad habits to break. By closing the shower curtain after each use, it will dry more quickly and discourage mildew  growth. By hanging wet towels to dry, you’ll get a second or third use and lighten your laundry loads.</p>
<h2 id="3-Using-Too-Much-Cleaning-Product"><a href="#3-Using-Too-Much-Cleaning-Product" class="headerlink" title="3. Using Too Much Cleaning Product"></a>3. Using Too Much Cleaning Product</h2><p>If a little bit of cleaner works, then a lot of cleaner will work better and faster? Right? That’s not how it works.</p>
<p>Using too much cleaner or laundry detergent can actually cause more harm than good. If an excess of cleaning product is not rinsed away completely, the residue becomes a dirt magnet, trapping soil. That’s why you should read directions and always use the recommended amount or even a little less. You’re wasting time and money on the extra product and the water to rinse it away.</p>
<h2 id="4-Cleaning-With-Dirty-Tools"><a href="#4-Cleaning-With-Dirty-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4. Cleaning With Dirty Tools"></a>4. Cleaning With Dirty Tools</h2><p>How can you expect clean results when you are using dirty cleaning tools? If your washer has an odor from built-up bacteria in detergent residue, your clothes are going to stink. If your vacuum bag or filter is filled with dust, it won’t do a good job sucking up any more. A dirty mop or sponge simply pushes around more soil and bacteria.</p>
<p>Take the time to thoroughly clean tools after every use by emptying completely or washing in hot water and adding a disinfectant. Periodically, replace with new tools.</p>
<h2 id="5-Using-One-Disinfectant-Wipe-to-Clean-Entire-Bathroom"><a href="#5-Using-One-Disinfectant-Wipe-to-Clean-Entire-Bathroom" class="headerlink" title="5. Using One Disinfectant Wipe to Clean Entire Bathroom"></a>5. Using One Disinfectant Wipe to Clean Entire Bathroom</h2><p>Disposable disinfectant wipes are great for a quick wipe down of a bathroom sink. But that little square hardly contains enough disinfectant to clean an entire bathroom. By the time you reach the toilet seat and handles, the disinfectant qualities are gone and you are simply spreading bacteria from one surface to another.</p>
<p>To be effective, the wipe should contain enough disinfectant moisture so the surface remains wet for at least four minutes. For a thorough cleaning, use multiple wipes or a clean cloth and sufficient disinfectant and water solution.</p>
<h2 id="6-Leaving-Dirty-Dishes-in-the-Sink"><a href="#6-Leaving-Dirty-Dishes-in-the-Sink" class="headerlink" title="6. Leaving Dirty Dishes in the Sink"></a>6. Leaving Dirty Dishes in the Sink</h2><p>How much longer would it take to put that dirty glass in the dishwasher instead of the sink? Leaving dirty dishes in the sink is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria and a jackpot for hungry insects. </p>
<p>Train everyone in the household to either put the dishes in the dishwasher or wash them immediately.</p>
<h2 id="7-Wearing-Outside-Shoes-in-the-House"><a href="#7-Wearing-Outside-Shoes-in-the-House" class="headerlink" title="7. Wearing Outside Shoes in the House"></a>7. Wearing Outside Shoes in the House</h2><p>Taking just a few seconds to remove your shoes each time you come in from the outside will save you hours of vacuuming. Not to mention the bacteria and germs that will stay out of living areas.</p>
<p>Whether entry is through a mudroom or the front door, make this habit  simple for everyone by providing a bench or chair for easier shoe removal. Keep a shoe tray close by for wet or muddy shoes and a bin to collect each family member’s footwear.</p>
<h2 id="8-Storing-Cleaning-Products-Incorrectly"><a href="#8-Storing-Cleaning-Products-Incorrectly" class="headerlink" title="8. Storing Cleaning Products Incorrectly"></a>8. Storing Cleaning Products Incorrectly</h2><p>Do you spend half your designated cleaning time trying to find the proper cleaners and tools? This is a bad habit that’s easy to change. </p>
<p>Gather together the cleaning supplies you need for each area of the home and store them close to that area. Bathroom cleaners can be placed in a small plastic carryall and stashed on a shelf or under the sink. Create two baskets of supplies if you have upstairs and downstairs bathrooms.</p>
<p>Keep dusting and furniture cleaning products and tools together for quick touch-ups. And, of course, all laundry products should be stored safely in the laundry room.</p>
<h2 id="9-Hoarding-Food-in-the-Refrigerator"><a href="#9-Hoarding-Food-in-the-Refrigerator" class="headerlink" title="9. Hoarding Food in the Refrigerator"></a>9. Hoarding Food in the Refrigerator</h2><p>If you know that your family hates leftovers, then why bother to stash them in the refrigerator? If you are not going to use food promptly, just go ahead and toss it. Improperly stored food promotes mold and bacteria growth and makes cleaning out the refrigerator a much bigger task than it needs to be.</p>
<h2 id="10-Leaving-Bed-Unmade"><a href="#10-Leaving-Bed-Unmade" class="headerlink" title="10. Leaving Bed Unmade"></a>10. Leaving Bed Unmade</h2><p>Even if the rest of the bedroom is neat and clean, an unmade bed makes it look messy. Just making the bed each morning is a habit that will promote keeping the rest of the room (and maybe the entire house) organized.</p>
<p>Make the task simple by selecting bedding that is easy to spread up neatly. A bed with a simple comforter and pillow shams is much easier to make than one with lots of fussy pillows.</p>
<h2 id="11-Not-Reading-Directions"><a href="#11-Not-Reading-Directions" class="headerlink" title="11. Not Reading Directions"></a>11. Not Reading Directions</h2><p>Have you ever had to redo a task like cleaning soap scum from tile because the cleaner didn’t work? Maybe you didn’t read the directions.</p>
<p>Most cleaners don’t work instantly and need a bit of time so that the ingredients can break down the soil and lift it so it can be easily wiped or rinsed away. Spend 30 seconds reading the directions to avoid 30 minutes of extra scrubbing.</p>
<h2 id="12-Using-Harsh-Cleaners"><a href="#12-Using-Harsh-Cleaners" class="headerlink" title="12. Using Harsh Cleaners"></a>12. Using Harsh Cleaners</h2><p>Just like using too much cleaner can be a bad habit, using a cleaner that is too harsh for the job is also wrong. You can do more harm than good if the cleaner strips away finishes or creates hazards for your pets and family.</p>
<p>A good example is chlorine bleach. While it is a good disinfectant, it is  not a good dirt and grime remover and the fumes can be toxic. Always use the gentlest cleaning products needed to produce results.</p>
<h2 id="13-Dusting-Last-When-Cleaning"><a href="#13-Dusting-Last-When-Cleaning" class="headerlink" title="13. Dusting Last When Cleaning"></a>13. Dusting Last When Cleaning</h2><p>Save yourself some effort by dusting before you vacuum. A room should be cleaned from the top down so the dust lands on the floor to be swept or vacuumed away. </p>
<p>And remember how that one disinfectant wipe can’t effectively clean an entire bathroom? The same goes for a disposable duster. If it has been awhile since you dusted, grab a clean duster when the one you’re using turns a solid grey. You’re no longer trapping dust, you’re just pushing it around with a dirty duster.</p>
<h2 id="14-Not-Completing-Tasks"><a href="#14-Not-Completing-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="14. Not Completing Tasks"></a>14. Not Completing Tasks</h2><p>We all get interrupted, but try to complete a task once you’ve started it. If you bring out the ironing board, don’t stop for a social media break until all of the ironing is done.</p>
<p>If you only have 15 minutes to clean, start by removing clutter and putting items in their proper place. Then if you get sidetracked, you can come back later to do the deeper cleaning.</p>
<h2 id="15-Waiting-Until-the-Cleaning-Job-is-Overwhelming"><a href="#15-Waiting-Until-the-Cleaning-Job-is-Overwhelming" class="headerlink" title="15. Waiting Until the Cleaning Job is Overwhelming"></a>15. Waiting Until the Cleaning Job is Overwhelming</h2><p>Putting off cleaning and waiting until the task has become overwhelming is one of the hardest bad habits to break. Most of us can’t face a disaster and simply avoid it for as long as possible.</p>
<p>But if you and your family do a bit of cleaning each day, like load and empty the dishwasher, complete a load of laundry, and vacuum one or two rooms, then cleaning the entire house will not be so overwhelming.</p>

  <h2 id="1-Banana-Bread"><a href="#1-Banana-Bread" class="headerlink" title="1. Banana Bread"></a>1. Banana Bread</h2><p>To this category, we can also add zucchini bread. Both banana and zucchini bread are dense, moist, sweet treats, usually chemically leavened with baking soda or powder. It’s supposed that both of these “quick” breads got their start in the United States, where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2017/02/23/short-history-of-banana-bread">18th-century bakers</a> first used pearlash, a refined form of potash, to create carbon dioxide in dough. Today, American bakers search online for banana bread recipes more often than any other bread. It’s so popular, it even has its own holiday: February 23 is National Banana Bread Day.</p>
<h2 id="2-Baguette"><a href="#2-Baguette" class="headerlink" title="2. Baguette"></a>2. Baguette</h2><p>Nothing else in the bread family, not even the wonderfully flaky croissant, conjures images of the Eiffel Tower and all things French the way the baguette does. The long, stick-like loaf, also called French bread (thanks to its origins), is made with flour, yeast, water, and salt. From those simple ingredients rises the iconic baguette, distinguished by its chewy crust, feather-light interior, and topside slashes, which allow for gas expansion during baking.</p>
<h2 id="3-Breadstick"><a href="#3-Breadstick" class="headerlink" title="3. Breadstick"></a>3. Breadstick</h2><p>Would it really be an Italian meal without a serving of this pencil-thin dry bread sitting atop the table as an appetizer? Much smaller than a baguette, breadsticks are said to have originated in the boot-shaped country in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/breadstuffs/breadstick-history.asp">17th century</a>. Nowadays, American restaurants sometimes serve them soft and warm, topped with cheese and garlic, or as a dessert, with icing and cinnamon.</p>
<h2 id="4-Brioche"><a href="#4-Brioche" class="headerlink" title="4. Brioche"></a>4. Brioche</h2><p>Our tastebuds owe the French a huge debt of gratitude for inventing brioche, a traditionally sweet yeast bread loaded with eggs and butter. People have been enjoying the golden, soft-as-a-pillow pastry forever—the word brioche <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/what-is-brioche">dates to 1404</a>—and it’s now commonly used as hamburger buns, dinner rolls and even in French toast recipes.</p>
<h2 id="5-Challah"><a href="#5-Challah" class="headerlink" title="5. Challah"></a>5. Challah</h2><p>Challah, which is made with eggs and most often braided, is integral to the Jewish faith. Served on the Sabbath and holidays, it was originally called <em>berches</em> before the word challah was adopted in the Middle Ages. The bread continues to carry rich <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/challah/">symbolism</a>, from the poppy and sesame seeds sprinkled on top that symbolize manna from God, to the plaited shape, which represents love.</p>
<h2 id="6-Ciabatta"><a href="#6-Ciabatta" class="headerlink" title="6. Ciabatta"></a>6. Ciabatta</h2><p>Ciabatta hails from Italy, where the word means “slipper” in the native language. Usually broad, flat and somewhat collapsed in the middle, it’s a lot more flavorful than footwear, and perfect for use in paninis and sandwiches. Unlike most of the bread on this list, this wheat flour-based bread is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.her.ie/life/food-for-thought-a-short-history-of-ciabatta-146594">recent invention</a>, first produced in 1982.</p>

Cornbread</h2><p>The bread maybe most associated with the region below the Mason-Dixon Line, cornbread originated with Native Americans. Made from finely-ground corn, wheat flour, eggs and milk (or buttermilk), Southern-style cornbread is traditionally baked in a skillet, either unleavened or with baking powder. Crumbly, rich and crispy, this classic cornbread should be enjoyed quickly, because it doesn’t store well.</p>
<h2 id="8-Focaccia"><a href="#8-Focaccia" class="headerlink" title="8. Focaccia"></a>8. Focaccia</h2><p>Another bread originating from Italy, focaccia is a flat, dimpled yeast bread resembling pizza dough that’s baked at high temperatures in sheet pans. Often topped with olive oil, rosemary and coarse salt, focaccia’s exact origins are unknown, though it might date back to Ancient Rome. Focaccia’s name is derived from the Latin <em>panis focacius</em>, which means fireplace bread. Modern varieties include savory toppings like olives, tomatoes, and mushrooms.</p>
<h2 id="9-Multigrain-Bread"><a href="#9-Multigrain-Bread" class="headerlink" title="9. Multigrain Bread"></a>9. Multigrain Bread</h2><p>Seemingly, not a lot of creativity went in to naming multigrain bread, since it’s defined simply as bread made from more than one grain. It can include flax, oats, and barley<strong>,</strong> but be aware that even bread made from wheat and a smidge of flour from a second grain can be called multigrain. If you’re looking for dense, hearty multigrain, which is terrific for sandwiches, be sure to check the label.</p>
<h2 id="10-Pita-Bread"><a href="#10-Pita-Bread" class="headerlink" title="10. Pita Bread"></a>10. Pita Bread</h2><p>Like tortillas and naan, pita is a flatbread. Soft and round, this slightly leavened bread, which originated in the Middle East some 4,000 years ago, is cooked at a high temperature. This causes the dough to puff up, leaving a handy interior pocket when it cools. Goodies like falafel can be stuffed into the pocket, although pitas are also wrapped around ingredients—as in the case of gyros—or used to scoop up dips such as hummus and tzatziki.</p>
<h2 id="11-Pumpernickel"><a href="#11-Pumpernickel" class="headerlink" title="11. Pumpernickel"></a>11. Pumpernickel</h2><p>A type of rye bread, flavorful pumpernickel hails from Germany, where it’s made with coarsely ground whole rye berries. The traditional version requires a lot of patience to create, since the recipe calls for baking pumpernickel at a low temperature for as long as 24 hours. Americans typically eschew the marathon oven session, instead producing pumpernickel’s dark hue by adding molasses or coffee.</p>
<h2 id="12-Rye-Bread"><a href="#12-Rye-Bread" class="headerlink" title="12. Rye Bread"></a>12. Rye Bread</h2><p>Crucial to beloved deli sandwiches like pastrami and corned beef-based Reubens, rye bread can come light, medium or dark, depending on which part of the rye berry is used to make the flour. In Europe, bakers tend to use 100% rye flour, while in the U.S., rye bread may be mainly made from wheat flour. Some recipes call for adding caraway or dill seeds on top.</p>
<h2 id="13-Soda-Bread"><a href="#13-Soda-Bread" class="headerlink" title="13. Soda Bread"></a>13. Soda Bread</h2><p>As anyone who seriously celebrates St. Patrick’s Day will tell you, the world’s most legendary soda bread comes courtesy of the Emerald Isle. Recipes vary widely between Ireland and the U.S., but traditional soda bread contains soft wheat flour, buttermilk, baking soda, and salt. Dense with a thick crust, this bread has a mild flavor, though in the U.S., bakers like to add raisins, giving it a slight sweetness.</p>
<h2 id="14-Sourdough"><a href="#14-Sourdough" class="headerlink" title="14. Sourdough"></a>14. Sourdough</h2><p>Thought to have originated in Egypt in 1500 B.C., sourdough bread is created via a long fermenting process using yeasts and lactobacilli that occur naturally. This creates lactic acid, which gives the bread its signature, slightly sour flavor. Sourdough bread, pretty much a trademark food for the San Francisco Bay area, is better for digestion and blood sugar control, as well as more nutritious, than many other kinds of bread.</p>
<h2 id="15-Whole-Wheat"><a href="#15-Whole-Wheat" class="headerlink" title="15. Whole Wheat"></a>15. Whole Wheat</h2><p>Speaking of healthy breads, whole wheat, which is one of a range of whole grain breads, is one of the very best breads for your body. Made from flour that uses the entire grain, including the bran and germ, whole wheat offers more fiber, protein, and vitamins than white bread. It also boasts a richer flavor and aroma.</p>

  <h2 id="Backwards-Compatibility"><a href="#Backwards-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Backwards Compatibility"></a>Backwards Compatibility</h2><p>Java is almost unique in being able to run code from 25 years ago on a modern version of Java. The language developers take backwards compatibility very seriously, and because of this many organisations are happy to make Java their primary development platform, knowing that the code will still run on the JVM for years to come.</p>
<h2 id="Maturity"><a href="#Maturity" class="headerlink" title="Maturity"></a>Maturity</h2><p>There are plenty of advantages to having been around for a long time. For the last 25 years, developers have been writing applications in Java for a huge range of industries and business types, and for different platforms. Meanwhile, over these 25 years, developers have been learning Java in schools, universities, boot camps, and on the job. This has created a large ecosystem that has had time to learn from experience and continues to grow. Java, and the problems it can solve, is well documented and well supported by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines">vendors and non-profit organisations</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java">individuals</a>. Very importantly for developers like us, the maturity and broad adoption of Java means there are plenty of jobs for developers who want to code in Java!</p>
<h2 id="Constant-Improvement"><a href="#Constant-Improvement" class="headerlink" title="Constant Improvement"></a>Constant Improvement</h2><p>In contrast to backwards compatibility and maturity, is the evolution of the platform and the language. Since 2017 (Java 9) there’s been a new release every six months, which has enabled a steady stream of changes and improvements to the language. Combined with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/preview-language-and-vm-features.html">Preview Features</a>, the language is able to experiment with new syntax, get feedback from developers, and then standardise new features that really work well for those who use the language.</p>
<h2 id="Balance"><a href="#Balance" class="headerlink" title="Balance"></a>Balance</h2><p>Java has a difficult balance to strike between backwards compatibility and embracing the future. The current approach of valuing backwards compatibility and releasing every six months, but with a<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html"> Long Term Support</a> release every three years, seems to strike the right balance. The language is able to evolve by providing warnings for deprecated features<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/core/enhanced-deprecation1.htm#JSCOR-GUID-E182DAF6-282B-4C1F-8CCF-0A61008E3F11"> that will be removed</a>, and by having replacements for anything that might go away.</p>
<p>Those who wish for extra stability can stay on a Long Term Support release. To reduce their risk when it does come time to upgrade, they could be regularly testing against every new release. Those who are happy to upgrade every six months can update to the latest version of Java every time it comes out. Developers who want to try out new syntax even before it’s standardised can<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/preview-language-and-vm-features.html"> enable preview features</a>, and those who want to do so as soon as possible can even use the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://jdk.java.net/"> Early Access</a> release of a version that’s not out. Teams using modern versions of Java really can have the best of all worlds.</p>
<h2 id="Standards"><a href="#Standards" class="headerlink" title="Standards"></a>Standards</h2><p>Standards might not be as exciting to a developer as language features, but having standards for Java, for<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html"> Java EE</a> and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/platform-spec-8.html"> Jakarta EE</a>, and for common use-cases that developers run into, does make a developer’s life easier. Understanding how to use JDBC to talk to a database means that we don’t have to care about how the database driver is implemented, the way we interact with it is always the same. The<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jcp.org/"> JCP</a> is one of the processes used to determine standards for Java.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/">Java Language Specification</a> covers what Java-the-language looks like and how the compiler should work. It includes the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4">Java Memory Model</a>, which can help us to predict how an application might behave, regardless of JVM or hardware. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se14/html/index.html">Java Virtual Machine Specification</a> covers the lower-level details down in the JVM. These specifications enable JDKs distributed by different vendors, running on different platforms, to behave in specified, predictable ways. Which leads us to…</p>
<h2 id="Write-Once-Run-Anywhere"><a href="#Write-Once-Run-Anywhere" class="headerlink" title="Write Once Run Anywhere"></a>Write Once Run Anywhere</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere">WORA</a> was one of the original ideas behind Java, which seems so obvious these days that we might not even realise how ground-breaking it was. I remember working for a very, very large organisation who, back in 2002, switched from their previous technology stack to Java simply because they had a lot of different hardware lying around, and being able to run new Java applications on it instead of having to buy specific hardware for applications was one of the main reasons they moved all their development to Java. In this day and age of Cloud this might seem less relevant, but in fact just because we don’t always see WORA in action does not mean we’re not still taking advantage of it. And of course, if you’re using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> (or NetBeans) you’re taking advantage of WORA on the desktop.</p>
<h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>It sometimes comes as a surprise to those who are less familiar with Java, but Java is a very high-performance language. It’s a mature platform that has 25 years of performance improvements; numerous garbage collectors with different performance profiles; and the JVM optimises our code at runtime for our real production use-cases far better than most human developers ever could. Java is used extensively in the finance world, for example, which depends on low-latency transactions and predictable performance.</p>
<h2 id="Memory-Management-and-Garbage-Collection"><a href="#Memory-Management-and-Garbage-Collection" class="headerlink" title="Memory Management and Garbage Collection"></a>Memory Management and Garbage Collection</h2><p>Automatic Garbage Collection is something else that, 25 years on, we generally take for granted. We don’t have to think about how memory is allocated in our applications, or how to free it. Each JVM has one or more different GC algorithms, so we can pick one that works well for our application without having to concern ourselves too much with the internals, we can just get on with writing the business logic for our applications.</p>
<h2 id="Observability-and-Management"><a href="#Observability-and-Management" class="headerlink" title="Observability and Management"></a>Observability and Management</h2><p>If we are interested in what’s going on while our application is running, there are a huge number of tools available to us. Many of them are even free, particularly since <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328">Java Flight Recorder</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/">Mission Control</a> are now part of OpenJDK (since Java 11). Tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/overview/index.html">JMX</a> even allow us to dynamically manage our applications too.</p>
<h2 id="The-Java-Virtual-Machine-JVM"><a href="#The-Java-Virtual-Machine-JVM" class="headerlink" title="The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)"></a>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h2><p>Many of the features we’ve just mentioned are features of the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine"> JVM</a>, but we specifically want to call out the JVM, and the fact that it’s separate from Java-the-language. There are many reasons to love the JVM, including some of the things we’ve already covered: WORA, runtime optimisations, performance, vendor choice, etc., much of which is made possible because of standards and specifications. It’s important that the JVM is separate from Java-the-language, too. It means different languages can be built upon the platform, taking advantage of all the great features of the JVM we’ve just mentioned while providing different types of syntax and language features.</p>
<h2 id="Other-JVM-Languages"><a href="#Other-JVM-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Other JVM Languages"></a>Other JVM Languages</h2><p>One of the reasons Java survived, even thrived, in those quiet years between Java 6 and 8 (Java 7 has some great features but it didn’t feel like a big release for Java developers) is because of the other JVM languages. At JetBrains of course our favourite is<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kotlinlang.org/"> Kotlin</a>, but the JVM is a platform for other popular languages like<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/"> Groovy</a>,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/"> Scala</a>,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clojure.org/"> Clojure</a> and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jruby.org/"> JRuby</a>, and a huge number of other<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages"> new and re-implemented languages</a>. In many cases,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html"> interoperability between these languages and classic Java</a> helps us to embrace and leverage this variety.</p>
<h2 id="Libraries-and-Frameworks"><a href="#Libraries-and-Frameworks" class="headerlink" title="Libraries and Frameworks"></a>Libraries and Frameworks</h2><p>One of the most compelling arguments is the huge amount of choice of libraries and frameworks we have, many of which are Open Source and free to use. Popular frameworks like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>, and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot"> Spring Boot</a> in particular, make it easy to create anything from small services to large and complex enterprise applications. Standards mean that often it’s not hard to understand and use a library when we’ve been using something similar in another context. The maturity of Java, and the community’s early adoption of open source, means that there’s usually an existing solution for standard problems; there’s no need to re-invent the wheel. It also means that since many of these solutions have been around, and in use, for a long time: they’re well tested, well understood, and well documented.</p>
<h2 id="Build-Tools-and-Dependency-Management"><a href="#Build-Tools-and-Dependency-Management" class="headerlink" title="Build Tools and Dependency Management"></a>Build Tools and Dependency Management</h2><p>Long gone are the days when a poor developer had to search on the internet for some unknown<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)"> JAR</a> file containing some class that the code they are trying to run apparently requires. Maven and Gradle, in particular, made it easy to build and deploy an application, of course, but also to set up a project in a standard way with all the required dependencies. It’s straightforward to start coding in either a new or existing project. Public repositories like<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maven.apache.org/repository/index.html"> Maven Central</a> and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bintray.com/"> Bintray</a> give us well-known places to find (and publish) libraries.</p>
<h2 id="JUnit-and-Automated-Testing"><a href="#JUnit-and-Automated-Testing" class="headerlink" title="JUnit and Automated Testing"></a>JUnit and Automated Testing</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a> was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Xunit.html">created in 1997</a> so is nearly as old as Java itself! It is by far the most common automated testing framework in the Java world, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-testing-libraries.html#">both JUnit and TestNG are shipped with IntelliJ IDEA</a> since it’s assumed a testing framework will be needed with any new Java project. It’s likely that modern testing frameworks for a whole range of languages are based on the ideas we now take for granted from JUnit. The Java community’s culture of automated testing owes a lot to this one library.</p>
<h2 id="IDEs"><a href="#IDEs" class="headerlink" title="IDEs"></a>IDEs</h2><p>This is the IntelliJ IDEA blog, we weren’t going to forget this one! Whether you believe the verbosity of Java requires an IDE, or that actually Java can really leverage an IDE because of its static typing, the fact is that Java developers love their IDEs (and we love you!). Learning to use an IDE effectively (whether it’s IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) can significantly improve a developer’s productivity, via: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/05/code-completion/">code completion</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/btqCYUc3nFE">generation</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/QDFI19lj4OM">running tests</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/lAWnIP1S6UA">debugging</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/1UHsJyCq1SU">navigation</a>, and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/04/tips-for-writing-code-in-intellij-idea/">bunch of other features</a>. Java developers are usually extremely enthusiastic about the benefits an IDE brings.</p>
<h2 id="Community"><a href="#Community" class="headerlink" title="Community"></a>Community</h2><p>The Java Community is a large, mature, vibrant, and welcoming community. There are<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://community.oracle.com/community/groundbreakers/java/jug"> Java User Groups</a> in many cities worldwide, and a<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://virtualjug.com/"> Virtual Java User Group</a> if you can’t get to a physical meetup. The<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://community.oracle.com/community/groundbreakers/java/java-champions"> Java Champions</a> are recognised technical leaders in the Java world who became known for sharing things that are useful or interesting for Java and JVM developers. Java has a huge Open Source community, including the JDK itself via<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openjdk.java.net/"> OpenJDK</a>. The Java Community values learning, teaching, and constant improvement, cares about standards and “best practice”, and is pragmatic about how to apply these in a real-world environment.</p>
<h2 id="People"><a href="#People" class="headerlink" title="People"></a>People</h2><p>The Community is made up of people, of course, but when I asked what developers value most about Java, many of them specifically called out individuals in the Java world who had impacted them. These range from colleagues and teachers, to people like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz">Brian Goetz</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techgirl1908">Angie Jones</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/gsaab">Georges Saab</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://ejavaguru.com/about/malagupta.html">Mala Gupta</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. Some people even mentioned <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/trisha_gee">me</a>. Personally, I came to Java because I learnt it at university and there were plenty of jobs, but I stayed because I love the people and the help and support I’ve had from them.</p>
<h2 id="Javadoc-and-Documentation"><a href="#Javadoc-and-Documentation" class="headerlink" title="Javadoc and Documentation"></a>Javadoc and Documentation</h2><p>Java makes API documentation a key part of the language via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html">Javadoc</a>. The three different types of comments (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html">Javadoc</a>, block and line) clearly indicates what sort of commentary a developer is leaving. Javadoc specifically encourages developers to leave helpful documentation for other developers who call a method, or use a class or package. If a developer cannot find detailed tutorial information on a library or piece of code, there’s usually Javadoc that can help point them in the right direction.</p>
<p>In addition, the Java ecosystem generally seems to expect (and provide) good quality documentation for developers. Prospective committers to open source projects are encouraged to submit pull request of Javadoc comments or other documentation, and developers all over the world <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java">ask and answer questions on StackOverflow</a>, or blog about solutions to specific problems.</p>
<h2 id="Open-Source"><a href="#Open-Source" class="headerlink" title="Open Source"></a>Open Source</h2><p>Not only did the Java community embrace open source early on, but now the JDK itself is open source too via<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://openjdk.java.net/"> OpenJDK</a>. Open source makes it easier for multiple vendors, and individuals, to be involved and collaborate. It’s also fascinating to be able to look at the code of Java itself. Open source code provides a great opportunity for developers like us to learn from people who have already done all the hard work thinking about and solving complicated problems.</p>
<h2 id="Free"><a href="#Free" class="headerlink" title="Free"></a>Free</h2><p>The Java platform and many of the most popular tools used in the Java ecosystem don’t require a developer (or often even a profit-making organisation) to pay money to use them. Even after Oracle <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/09/using-java-11-in-production-important-things-to-know/">changed its licensing and support in Java 11</a> they (and many other vendors) still <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nFGazvrCvHMZJgFstlbzoHjpAVwv5DEdnaBr_5pKuHo/edit?usp=sharing">provided a way to use the language for free in production</a>. The open source projects, build tools, and IDEs already mentioned in this article are all either free or have a free option. This makes Java appealing for developers getting started with coding, and for organisations of all sizes who need to build software while keeping an eye on the budget.</p>
<h2 id="Object-Oriented"><a href="#Object-Oriented" class="headerlink" title="Object-Oriented"></a>Object-Oriented</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-oriented programming</a> is not the only game in town, of course, and every paradigm has its advantages and disadvantages. Java was designed as an OO language right from the start, and many examples of design patterns and other coding best practice for OO are demonstrated in Java. If you want an object-oriented programming language, Java should be high on your list of ones to try.</p>
<h2 id="Evolution-and-Adaptation"><a href="#Evolution-and-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Evolution and Adaptation"></a>Evolution and Adaptation</h2><p>Java was, and still is, an object-oriented programming language. But it has also successfully adopted some concepts from functional programming (like lambda expressions and immutable data structures) and made them work nicely within the OO paradigm. Type inference (for example<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286"> var</a>) allows us to still have the benefits of a statically typed language, but with less boilerplate. Computer science is still a relatively young discipline, yet as we learn things they can be applied to our existing tools. Java (the language and the whole ecosystem) is constantly evolving according to new trends and new “best practices”, and also as a result of seeing how things work out in the real world.</p>
<p>Java also gets to benefit from syntax and ideas from other JVM languages, to see what works and what perhaps might not fit in a classic Java world. Even the processes and tools that Java uses to evolve and grow, such as the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=java+community+process"> JCP</a> and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openjdk.java.net/"> OpenJDK</a>, are also adapting themselves to stay relevant in this constant evolution. This evolution and adaptation is part of the careful balance Java has to strike.</p>
<h2 id="Focus-on-Readability"><a href="#Focus-on-Readability" class="headerlink" title="Focus on Readability"></a>Focus on Readability</h2><p>Java code is often readable, even for non-Java programmers. The language leans towards being more verbose rather than over-concise, which makes it easier to reason about Java code when we’re reading it. The language developers have not implemented features like operator overloading, as they feel it’s important to not be surprised by unexpected custom behaviour. There’s a tendency to avoid “magic” in the language and the frameworks – although some frameworks will use things like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">Convention over configuration</a> to do things without a developer having to be imperative about it. There’s definitely been a move away from,for example, doing lots of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.15.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html">AOP with annotations</a>, and more towards using annotations for documentation and static analysis checks. The community and ecosystem tend to like standards and “best practice”, so Java code often follows similar sorts of rules even on very different projects.</p>
<h2 id="Language-Features"><a href="#Language-Features" class="headerlink" title="Language Features"></a>Language Features</h2><p>We’ve covered 23 Things We Like About Java but haven’t mentioned a single feature! To be honest, it’s because limiting ourselves to just 25 features seemed extremely difficult, and also because lots of the things we love about Java are not about the syntax or features. We’d like to give an honourable shout out to some of developers’ favourite features:</p>
<ul>

<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html">Streams API</a>: a very nice addition to the collections API, and great to see it evolving even since Java 8. Parallel streams added a new way to utilise modern hardware.</li>

Really nice to see each improvement to Optional since Java 8 as well.</li>
